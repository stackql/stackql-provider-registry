            - The sort order is based on the difference of the values of the chosen column between the first two date ranges. Usable only if there are exactly two date ranges.
            - The sort order is based on weighted value of the chosen column. If column has n/d format, then weighted value of this ratio will be `(n + totals.n)/(d + totals.d)` Usable only for metrics that represent ratios.
            - Histogram order type is applicable only to dimension columns with non-empty histogram-buckets.
            - If the dimensions are fixed length numbers, ordinary sort would just work fine. `DIMENSION_AS_INTEGER` can be used if the dimensions are variable length numbers.

Each bucket is closed on the lower end, and open on the upper end. The "first" bucket includes all values less than the first boundary, the "last" bucket includes all values up to infinity. Dimension values that fall in a bucket get transformed to a new dimension value. For example, if one gives a list of "0, 1, 3, 4, 7", then we return the following buckets: - bucket #1: values < 0, dimension value "<0" - bucket #2: values in [0,1), dimension value "0" - bucket #3: values in [1,3), dimension value "1-2" - bucket #4: values in [3,4), dimension value "3" - bucket #5: values in [4,7), dimension value "4-6" - bucket #6: values >= 7, dimension value "7+" NOTE: If you are applying histogram mutation on any dimension, and using that dimension in sort, you will want to use the sort type `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` for that purpose. Without that the dimension values will be sorted according to dictionary (lexicographic) order. For example the ascending dictionary order is: "<50", "1001+", "121-1000", "50-120" And the ascending `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` order is: "<50", "50-120", "121-1000", "1001+" The client has to explicitly request `"orderType": "HISTOGRAM_BUCKET"` for a histogram-mutated dimension.'
