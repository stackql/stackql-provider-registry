In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort's granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.

The API returns a maximum of 100,000 rows per request, no matter how many you ask for. `limit` must be positive. The API can also return fewer rows than the requested `limit`, if there aren't as many dimension values as the `limit`. For instance, there are fewer than 300 possible values for the dimension `country`, so when reporting on only `country`, you can't get more than 300 rows, even if you set `limit` to a higher value.

For example, you could select the cohort of users that were acquired in the first week of September and follow that cohort for the next six weeks. Selecting the users acquired in the first week of September cohort is specified in the `cohort` object. Following that cohort for the next six weeks is specified in the `cohortsRange` object. For examples, see [Cohort Report Examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/advanced#cohort_report_examples). The report response could show a weekly time series where say your app has retained 60% of this cohort after three weeks and 25% of this cohort after six weeks. These two percentages can be calculated by the metric `cohortActiveUsers/cohortTotalUsers` and will be separate rows in the report.
