The target revision ID may only be used to write to recent versions of a form. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 (Bad Request Error). The request may be retried after reading the latest version of the form. In most cases a target revision ID remains valid for several minutes after it is read, but for frequently-edited forms this window may be shorter.
