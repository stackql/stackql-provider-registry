A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the presentation has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same presentation and user) usually means the presentation has been updated.

          enumDescriptions:

If the element is a placeholder shape as determined by the placeholder field, and it inherits from a placeholder shape, the corresponding field may be unset, meaning that the property value is inherited from a parent placeholder. If the element does not inherit, then the field will contain the rendered value. This is the default value.
            - If a property's state is NOT_RENDERED, then the element does not have the corresponding property when rendered on a page. However, the field may still be set so it can be inherited by child shapes. To remove a property from a rendered element, set its property_state to NOT_RENDERED.
            - If a property's state is INHERIT, then the property state uses the value of corresponding `property_state` field on the parent shape. Elements that do not inherit will never have an INHERIT property state.

However, when writing, if both fields are included in the field mask (either explicitly or through the wildcard `"*"`), their values are reconciled as follows: * If `font_family` is set and `weighted_font_family` is not, the value of `font_family` is applied with weight `400` ("normal"). * If both fields are set, the value of `font_family` must match that of `weighted_font_family#font_family`. If so, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value. Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned.'

If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `"ABC\n123"`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request.'
