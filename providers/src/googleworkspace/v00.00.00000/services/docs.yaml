The default value is `400` ("normal"). The font weight makes up just one component of the rendered font weight. A combination of the `weight` and the text style''s resolved `bold` value determine the rendered weight, after accounting for inheritance: * If the text is bold and the weight is less than `400`, the rendered weight is 400. * If the text is bold and the weight is greater than or equal to `400` but is less than `700`, the rendered weight is `700`. * If the weight is greater than or equal to `700`, the rendered weight is equal to the weight. * If the text is not bold, the rendered weight is equal to the weight.'

          description: The type of glyph used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. The glyph type determines the type of glyph used to replace placeholders within the glyph_format when paragraphs at this level of nesting are ordered. For example, if the nesting level is 0, the glyph_format is `%0.` and the glyph type is DECIMAL, then the rendered glyph would replace the placeholder `%0` in the glyph format with a number corresponding to list item's order within the list.
        glyphSymbol:
          type: string
          description: A custom glyph symbol used by bullets when paragraphs at this level of nesting are unordered. The glyph symbol replaces placeholders within the glyph_format. For example, if the glyph_symbol is the solid circle corresponding to Unicode U+25cf code point and the glyph_format is `%0`, the rendered glyph would be the solid circle.

          description: The amount of indentation for paragraphs at this level of nesting. Applied to the side that corresponds to the start of the text, based on the paragraph's content direction.
        glyphFormat:
          description: The format string used by bullets at this level of nesting. The glyph format contains one or more placeholders, and these placeholders are replaced with the appropriate values depending on the glyph_type or glyph_symbol. The placeholders follow the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Furthermore, placeholders can have prefixes and suffixes. Thus, the glyph format follows the pattern `%[nesting_level]`. Note that the prefix and suffix are optional and can be arbitrary strings. For example, the glyph format `%0.` indicates that the rendered glyph will replace the placeholder with the corresponding glyph for nesting level 0 followed by a period as the suffix. So a list with a glyph type of UPPER_ALPHA and glyph format `%0.` at nesting level 0 will result in a list with rendered glyphs `A.` `B.` `C.` The glyph format can contain placeholders for the current nesting level as well as placeholders for parent nesting levels. For example, a list can have a glyph format of `%0.` at nesting level 0 and a glyph format of `%0.%1.` at nesting level 1. Assuming both nesting levels have DECIMAL glyph types, this would result in a list with rendered glyphs `1.` `2.` ` 2.1.` ` 2.2.` `3.` For nesting levels that are ordered, the string that replaces a placeholder in the glyph format for a particular paragraph depends on the paragraph's order within the list.

          description: The optional target revision ID of the document the write request is applied to. If collaborator changes have occurred after the document was read using the API, the changes produced by this write request are applied against the collaborator changes. This results in a new revision of the document that incorporates both the collaborator changes and the changes in the request, with the Docs server resolving conflicting changes. When using target revision ID, the API client can be thought of as another collaborator of the document. The target revision ID can only be used to write to recent versions of a document. If the target revision is too far behind the latest revision, the request is not processed and returns a 400 bad request error. The request should be tried again after retrieving the latest version of the document. Usually a revision ID remains valid for use as a target revision for several minutes after it's read, but for frequently edited documents this window might be shorter.

Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the document, the document might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the document should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically.'
