      description: 'Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor''s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn''t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(''alpha'' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join('',''); return [''rgba('', rgbParams, '','', alphaFrac, '')''].join(''''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [''#'']; for (var i = 0; i < missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(''0''); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''''); }; // ...'

      description: 'A range on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. Indexes are half open, i.e. the start index is inclusive and the end index is exclusive -- [start_index, end_index). Missing indexes indicate the range is unbounded on that side. For example, if `"Sheet1"` is sheet ID 123456, then: `Sheet1!A1:A1 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 0, end_row_index: 1, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 1` `Sheet1!A3:B4 == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 2, end_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1!A5:B == sheet_id: 123456, start_row_index: 4, start_column_index: 0, end_column_index: 2` `Sheet1 == sheet_id: 123456` The start index must always be less than or equal to the end index. If the start index equals the end index, then the range is empty. Empty ranges are typically not meaningful and are usually rendered in the UI as `#REF!`.'

For example, January 1st 1900 at noon would be 2.5, 2 because it's 2 days after December 30th 1899, and .5 because noon is half a day. February 1st 1900 at 3pm would be 33.625.

          enumDescriptions:
            - Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields to be output as doubles in "serial number" format, as popularized by Lotus 1-2-3. The whole number portion of the value (left of the decimal) counts the days since December 30th 1899. The fractional portion (right of the decimal) counts the time as a fraction of the day. For example, January 1st 1900 at noon would be 2.5, 2 because it's 2 days after December 30th 1899, and .5 because noon is half a day. February 1st 1900 at 3pm would be 33.625. This correctly treats the year 1900 as not a leap year.
            - Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields to be output as strings in their given number format (which depends on the spreadsheet locale).

          enumDescriptions:
            - Values will be calculated & formatted in the reply according to the cell's formatting. Formatting is based on the spreadsheet's locale, not the requesting user's locale. For example, if `A1` is `1.23` and `A2` is `=A1` and formatted as currency, then `A2` would return `"$1.23"`.
            - Values will be calculated, but not formatted in the reply. For example, if `A1` is `1.23` and `A2` is `=A1` and formatted as currency, then `A2` would return the number `1.23`.
            - Values will not be calculated. The reply will include the formulas. For example, if `A1` is `1.23` and `A2` is `=A1` and formatted as currency, then A2 would return `"=A1"`.
