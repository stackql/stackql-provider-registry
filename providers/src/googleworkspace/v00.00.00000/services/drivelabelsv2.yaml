        The lifecycle enforces the following transitions: * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT`
        (starting state) * `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -> `PUBLISHED` *
        `UNPUBLISHED_DRAFT` -> (Deleted) * `PUBLISHED` -> `DISABLED` *
        `DISABLED` -> `PUBLISHED` * `DISABLED` -> (Deleted) The published and
        disabled states have some distinct characteristics: * `Published`: Some
        kinds of changes might be made to an object in this state, in which case
        `has_unpublished_changes` will be true. Also, some kinds of changes
        aren't permitted. Generally, any change that would invalidate or cause
        new restrictions on existing metadata related to the label are rejected.
        * `Disabled`: When disabled, the configured `DisabledPolicy` takes
        effect.

    GoogleTypeColor:

      description: >-
        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...
        public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha =
        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return
        new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(),
        protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color
        toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed();
        float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float)
        color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder
        = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green /
        denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha();
        if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder()
        .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return
        resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static
        UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red];
        float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue];
        FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if
        (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return
        [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static
        Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if
        (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return
        nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red];

            means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a

            uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it

            being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid

        Publish all draft changes to the label. Once published, the label may
        not return to its draft state. For more information, see [Create and
        publish a
        label](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/labels/guides/create-label).
        Publishing a label will result in a new published revision. All previous
        draft revisions will be deleted. Previous published revisions will be
        kept but are subject to automated deletion as needed. For more
        information, see [Label
        lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/labels/guides/label-lifecycle).
        Once published, some changes are no longer permitted. Generally, any
        change that would invalidate or cause new restrictions on existing
        metadata related to the label will be rejected. For example, the
        following changes to a label will be rejected after the label is
        published: * The label cannot be directly deleted. It must be disabled
        first, then deleted. * `Field.FieldType` cannot be changed. * Changes to
        field validation options cannot reject something that was previously
        accepted. * Reducing the maximum entries.

        and delete a
        label](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/labels/guides/disable-delete-label).
        Disabling a label will result in a new disabled published revision based
        on the current published revision. If there's a draft revision, a new
        disabled draft revision will be created based on the latest draft
        revision. Older draft revisions will be deleted. Once disabled, a label
        may be deleted with `DeleteLabel`.
