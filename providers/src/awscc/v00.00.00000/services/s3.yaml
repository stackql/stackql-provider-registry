        Describes the default server-side encryption to apply to new objects in the bucket. If a PUT Object request doesn't specify any server-side encryption, this default encryption will be applied. If you don't specify a customer managed key at configuration, Amazon S3 automatically creates an AWS KMS key in your AWS account the first time that you add an object encrypted with SSE-KMS to a bucket. By default, Amazon S3 uses this KMS key for SSE-KMS. For more information, see [PUT Bucket
        encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTencryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

    NotificationConfiguration:
      description: |-
        Describes the notification configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket.
          If you create the target resource and related permissions in the same template, you might have a circular dependency.
         For example, you might use the ``AWS::Lambda::Permission`` resource to grant the bucket permission to invoke an AWS Lambda function. However, AWS CloudFormation can't create the bucket until the bucket has permission to invoke the function (AWS CloudFormation checks whether the bucket can invoke the function). If you're using Refs to pass the bucket name, this leads to a circular dependency.
         To avoid this dependency, you can create all resources without specifying the notification configuration. Then, update the stack with a notification configuration.
         For more information on permissions, see [AWS::Lambda::Permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html) and [Granting Permissions to Publish Event Notification Messages to a Destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#grant-destinations-permissions-to-s3).

            A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A ``Filter`` must specify exactly one ``Prefix``, ``TagFilter``, or an ``And`` child element. The use of the filter field indicates that this is a V2 replication configuration. This field isn't supported in a V1 replication configuration.
              V1 replication configuration only supports filtering by key prefix. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element.
        Id:
          description: A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation generates a random ID. When using a V2 replication configuration this property is capitalized as "ID".
          type: string
          maxLength: 255
        Prefix:
          description: |-
            An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string. To filter using a V1 replication configuration, add the ``Prefix`` directly as a child element of the ``Rule`` element.
              Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see [XML related object key constraints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).

        Priority:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

      description: >-
        Specifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a ``Filter`` in your replication configuration, you must also include a ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` element. If your ``Filter`` includes a ``Tag`` element, the ``DeleteMarkerReplication`` ``Status`` must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see [Basic Rule
        Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config).
