        Creates a Firewall to filter network traffic.


        - Use `rules` to create inbound and outbound access rules. Rule versions
        increment from `1` whenever the firewall's `rules` change.


        - Use `devices` to assign a firewall to a service such as a Linode that
        is using legacy config profiles, a Linode interface or a NodeBalancer.
        The firewall’s rules are then applied to that service. Requires a
        `read_write` [user
        grant](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-user-grants)
        to the device.

          - For Linodes using Linode interfaces, firewalls need to be assigned to `interfaces` and not the `linodes`. Firewall templates are available for both VPC Linode interfaces and public Linode interfaces, and come with pre-configured protection rules.

          - For Linodes using legacy configuration profiles, firewalls are applied through the Linode. Public and VPC interfaces are subject to the firewall rules, while VLAN interfaces are not.

        - Currently, firewalls can be assigned to Linodes with legacy
        configuration profiles, Linode interfaces, and NodeBalancers.

            - The same firewall can be assigned to multiple services at a time.

        - Use `firewall_id` to assign a firewall when [creating a
        Linode](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance)
        or when [adding a Linode
        interface](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-interface).


        - A service can have one assigned firewall enabled at a time.


        - Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.


        - A `firewall_create` event is generated when this operation succeeds.

                        The inbound and outbound access rules to apply to the
                        Firewall.


                        A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound
                        and outbound rulesets.


                        Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules
                        conflict, the first rule takes precedence. For example,
                        if the first rule accepts inbound traffic from an
                        address, and the second rule drops inbound traffic the
                        same address, the first rule applies and inbound traffic
                        from that address is accepted.

                                  A string representing the port or ports
                                  affected by this rule:


                                  - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                  ports, or a comma-separated list of single
                                  ports and port ranges. A space is permitted
                                  following each comma.

                                  - A range of ports is inclusive of the start
                                  and end values for the range. The end value of
                                  the range must be greater than the start
                                  value.

                                  - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may
                                  not contain any leading zeroes. For example,
                                  port `080` is not allowed.

                                  - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                  where a single port is treated as one piece,
                                  and a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                  example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                  pieces.

                                  - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                  affected.

                                  - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                  Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                  protocols.

                                  A string representing the port or ports
                                  affected by this rule:


                                  - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                  ports, or a comma-separated list of single
                                  ports and port ranges. A space is permitted
                                  following each comma.

                                  - A range of ports is inclusive of the start
                                  and end values for the range. The end value of
                                  the range must be greater than the start
                                  value.

                                  - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may
                                  not contain any leading zeroes. For example,
                                  port `080` is not allowed.

                                  - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                  where a single port is treated as one piece,
                                  and a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                  example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                  pieces.

                                  - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                  affected.

                                  - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                  Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                  protocols.

                      Firewall labels have the following constraints:

                        - Must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.
                        - May only consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`) or periods (`.`).
                        - Cannot have two hyphens (`--`), underscores (`__`) or periods (`..`) in a row.
                        - Must be between 3 and 32 characters.
                        - Must be unique.

                      A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                      outbound rulesets.


                      Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules
                      conflict, the first rule takes precedence. For example, if
                      the first rule accepts inbound traffic from an address,
                      and the second rule drops inbound traffic the same
                      address, the first rule applies and inbound traffic from
                      that address is accepted.

                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.
                              example: 22-24, 80, 443

                            Firewall labels have the following constraints:

                              - Must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.
                              - May only consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`) or periods (`.`).
                              - Cannot have two hyphens (`--`), underscores (`__`) or periods (`..`) in a row.
                              - Must be between 3 and 32 characters.

                            A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its
                            inbound and outbound rulesets.


                            Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules
                            conflict, the first rule takes precedence. For
                            example, if the first rule accepts inbound traffic
                            from an address, and the second rule drops inbound
                            traffic the same address, the first rule applies and
                            inbound traffic from that address is accepted.

                                      A string representing the port or ports
                                      affected by this rule:


                                      - The string may be a single port, a range
                                      of ports, or a comma-separated list of
                                      single ports and port ranges. A space is
                                      permitted following each comma.

                                      - A range of ports is inclusive of the
                                      start and end values for the range. The
                                      end value of the range must be greater
                                      than the start value.

                                      - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and
                                      may not contain any leading zeroes. For
                                      example, port `080` is not allowed.

                                      - The ports string can have up to 15
                                      _pieces_, where a single port is treated
                                      as one piece, and a port range is treated
                                      as two pieces. For example, the string
                                      "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                                      - If no ports are configured, all ports
                                      are affected.

                                      - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP
                                      protocols. Ports are not allowed for the
                                      ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

                                      A string representing the port or ports
                                      affected by this rule:


                                      - The string may be a single port, a range
                                      of ports, or a comma-separated list of
                                      single ports and port ranges. A space is
                                      permitted following each comma.

                                      - A range of ports is inclusive of the
                                      start and end values for the range. The
                                      end value of the range must be greater
                                      than the start value.

                                      - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and
                                      may not contain any leading zeroes. For
                                      example, port `080` is not allowed.

                                      - The ports string can have up to 15
                                      _pieces_, where a single port is treated
                                      as one piece, and a port range is treated
                                      as two pieces. For example, the string
                                      "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                                      - If no ports are configured, all ports
                                      are affected.

                                      - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP
                                      protocols. Ports are not allowed for the
                                      ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

                                      A string representing the port or ports
                                      affected by this rule:


                                      - The string may be a single port, a range
                                      of ports, or a comma-separated list of
                                      single ports and port ranges. A space is
                                      permitted following each comma.

                                      - A range of ports is inclusive of the
                                      start and end values for the range. The
                                      end value of the range must be greater
                                      than the start value.

                                      - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and
                                      may not contain any leading zeroes. For
                                      example, port `080` is not allowed.

                                      - The ports string can have up to 15
                                      _pieces_, where a single port is treated
                                      as one piece, and a port range is treated
                                      as two pieces. For example, the string
                                      "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                                      - If no ports are configured, all ports
                                      are affected.

                                      - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP
                                      protocols. Ports are not allowed for the
                                      ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

                                      permitted following each comma.

                                      - A range of ports is inclusive of the
                                      start and end values for the range. The
                                      end value of the range must be greater
                                      than the start value.

                                      - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and
                                      may not contain any leading zeroes. For
                                      example, port `080` is not allowed.

                                      - The ports string can have up to 15
                                      _pieces_, where a single port is treated
                                      as one piece, and a port range is treated
                                      as two pieces. For example, the string
                                      "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                                      - If no ports are configured, all ports
                                      are affected.

                                      - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP
                                      protocols. Ports are not allowed for the
                                      ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

        __Beta__ Gets a `vpc` or `public` firewall template you can use with
        Linode VPC and public interfaces. Firewall templates come with some
        protection rules already configured.


        The public interface's firewall template allows for login with SSH, and
        regular networking control data. You should further strengthen these
        rules by limiting the allowed IPv4 and IPv6 ranges.


        The VPC interface's firewall template allows for login with SSH, regular
        networking control data, and inbound traffic from the VPC address space.
        You should further strengthen these rules by limiting the allowed IPv4
        and IPv6 ranges.

                      A firewall can have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                      outbound rule sets. Multiple rules are applied in order.
                      If two rules conflict, the first rule takes precedence.
                      For example, if the first rule accepts inbound traffic
                      from an address, and the second rule drops inbound traffic
                      from the same address, the first rule applies, and inbound
                      traffic from that address is accepted.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                                    Addresses must be in IP/mask format and must

                            ports:
                              description: >-
                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.
                              example: 22-24, 80, 443

                      The inbound and outbound access rules to apply to the
                      Firewall.


                      A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                      outbound rulesets.


                      Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules
                      conflict, the first rule takes precedence. For example, if
                      the first rule accepts inbound traffic from an address,
                      and the second rule drops inbound traffic the same
                      address, the first rule applies and inbound traffic from
                      that address is accepted.

                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                            ports:
                              description: >-
                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.
                              example: 22-24, 80, 443
                              nullable: true

        Updates information for a firewall.


        - Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.


        - If this operation changes a firewall's status, it generates a
        corresponding `firewall_enable` or `firewall_disable` event.


        This operation doesn't affect some parts of a firewall's configuration:


        - This operation doesn't set a firewall's devices. Instead, run the
        [Create a firewall
        device](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-firewall-device)
        and [Delete a firewall
        device](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-firewall-device)
        operations to assign and remove this firewall from services.


        - A firewall's rules can't be changed with this operation. Instead, run
        the [Update firewall
        rules](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-firewall-rules)
        operation to update your rules.


        - Use this operation to set a firewall's status to `enabled` or
        `disabled`.  But to set it to `deleted`, run the [Delete a
        firewall](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-firewall)
        operation.


        - An assigned default firewall can't be disabled.

                      A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                      outbound rulesets.


                      Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules
                      conflict, the first rule takes precedence. For example, if
                      the first rule accepts inbound traffic from an address,
                      and the second rule drops inbound traffic the same
                      address, the first rule applies and inbound traffic from
                      that address is accepted.

                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.
                              example: 22-24, 80, 443

        Creates a firewall device, which assigns a firewall to a service
        (referred to as the device's `entity`) and applies the firewall's rules
        to the device.


        - Currently, devices with `linode`, `interface`, and `nodebalancer`
        entity types are accepted.
          - The `linode` type is not allowed for Linodes using Linode interfaces.
          - The `interface` type is not allowed for legacy config interfaces. For VPC and public legacy config profile interfaces, the firewall is applied through the `linode` device.

        - Firewalls only apply to inbound TCP traffic to NodeBalancers.


        - A firewall can be assigned to multiple services at a time.


        - A service can have one assigned firewall at a time.


        - Assigned Linodes must not have any ongoing live migrations.


        - A `firewall_device_add` event is generated when the firewall device is
        added successfully.

                      address, the first rule applies and inbound traffic from

                                rule. A rule can have up to 255 total addresses
                                or networks listed across its `ipv4` and `ipv6`
                                arrays. A network and a single IP are treated as
                                equivalent when accounting for this limit.


                                Must contain `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or both.
                              properties:

                                    If `0.0.0.0/0` is included in this list, all
                                    IPv4 addresses are affected by this rule.

                                    Addresses must be in IP/mask format and must
                                    not include zone_id notation as described in
                                    [RFC

                                    Must not be an empty list.


                                    If `::/0` is included in this list, all IPv6
                                    addresses are affected by this rule.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                equivalent when accounting for this limit.


                                Must contain `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or both.

                                    If `0.0.0.0/0` is included in this list, all
                                    IPv4 addresses are affected by this rule.

                                    A list of IPv6 addresses or networks.
                                    Addresses must be in IP/mask format and must
                                    not include zone_id notation as described in
                                    [RFC

                                    Must not be an empty list.


                                    If `::/0` is included in this list, all IPv6
                                    addresses are affected by this rule.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                                A string representing the port or ports affected
                                by this rule:


                                - The string may be a single port, a range of
                                ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                                and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                                each comma.

                                - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                                end values for the range. The end value of the
                                range must be greater than the start value.

                                - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                                contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                                `080` is not allowed.

                                - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                where a single port is treated as one piece, and
                                a port range is treated as two pieces. For
                                example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four
                                pieces.

                                - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                affected.

                                - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                                protocols.

                  A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                  outbound rulesets.


                  Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules conflict,
                  the first rule takes precedence. For example, if the first
                  rule accepts inbound traffic from an address, and the second
                  rule drops inbound traffic the same address, the first rule
                  applies and inbound traffic from that address is accepted.

                            this rule:


                            - The string may be a single port, a range of ports,
                            or a comma-separated list of single ports and port
                            ranges. A space is permitted following each comma.

                            - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and end
                            values for the range. The end value of the range
                            must be greater than the start value.

                            - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                            contain any leading zeroes. For example, port `080`
                            is not allowed.

                            - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_, where
                            a single port is treated as one piece, and a port
                            range is treated as two pieces. For example, the
                            string "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                            - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                            affected.

                            - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols. Ports
                            are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

                            ranges. A space is permitted following each comma.

                            values for the range. The end value of the range
                            must be greater than the start value.

                            - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                            contain any leading zeroes. For example, port `080`
                            is not allowed.

                            - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_, where
                            a single port is treated as one piece, and a port

                    The inbound and outbound access rules to apply to the
                    Firewall.


                    A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                    outbound rulesets.


                    Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules conflict,
                    the first rule takes precedence. For example, if the first
                    rule accepts inbound traffic from an address, and the second
                    rule drops inbound traffic the same address, the first rule
                    applies and inbound traffic from that address is accepted.

                        represents the firewall rules as an 8 character hex
                        string. You can use `fingerprint` to compare rule
                        versions.

                              A string representing the port or ports affected
                              by this rule:


                              - The string may be a single port, a range of
                              ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                              and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                              each comma.

                              - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                              end values for the range. The end value of the
                              range must be greater than the start value.

                              - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                              contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                              `080` is not allowed.

                              - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                              where a single port is treated as one piece, and a
                              port range is treated as two pieces. For example,
                              the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                              - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                              affected.

                              - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                              Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                              protocols.

                              A string representing the port or ports affected
                              by this rule:


                              - The string may be a single port, a range of
                              ports, or a comma-separated list of single ports
                              and port ranges. A space is permitted following
                              each comma.

                              - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and
                              end values for the range. The end value of the
                              range must be greater than the start value.

                              - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                              contain any leading zeroes. For example, port
                              `080` is not allowed.

                              - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                              where a single port is treated as one piece, and a
                              port range is treated as two pieces. For example,
                              the string "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                              - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                              affected.

                              - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                              Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP
                              protocols.

                  A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and
                  outbound rulesets.


                  Multiple rules are applied in order. If two rules conflict,
                  the first rule takes precedence. For example, if the first
                  rule accepts inbound traffic from an address, and the second
                  rule drops inbound traffic the same address, the first rule
                  applies and inbound traffic from that address is accepted.

                            The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses affected by this rule. A
                            rule can have up to 255 total addresses or networks
                            listed across its `ipv4` and `ipv6` arrays. A
                            network and a single IP are treated as equivalent
                            when accounting for this limit.


                            Must contain `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or both.

                                IPv4 addresses are affected by this rule.
                              example:

                                Must not be an empty list.


                                If `::/0` is included in this list, all IPv6

                            A string representing the port or ports affected by
                            this rule:


                            - The string may be a single port, a range of ports,
                            or a comma-separated list of single ports and port
                            ranges. A space is permitted following each comma.

                            - A range of ports is inclusive of the start and end
                            values for the range. The end value of the range
                            must be greater than the start value.

                            - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may not
                            contain any leading zeroes. For example, port `080`
                            is not allowed.

                            - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_, where
                            a single port is treated as one piece, and a port
                            range is treated as two pieces. For example, the
                            string "22-24, 80, 443" has four pieces.

                            - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                            affected.

                            - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols. Ports
                            are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP protocols.

        Assign any set of IPv4 addresses and IPv6 ranges to Linodes in one
        region. This allows swapping, shuffling, or otherwise reorganizing IPs
        among your Linodes.


        The following restrictions apply:


        - All Linodes need to have at least one public IPv4 address assigned.
          - For Linode interfaces, the Linode needs to have a public interface, and the address it receives can't be a private IPv4 address.
        - Linodes may have no more than one assigned private IPv4 address.

        - Linodes may have no more than one assigned IPv6 range.

        - Shared IP addresses cannot be swapped between Linodes.


        [Open a support
        ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket) to
        request additional IPv4 addresses or IPv6 ranges beyond standard account

                          - Assignment of an IPv6 range to a Linode updates the
                          route target of the range to the assigned Linode's
                          SLAAC address.

                          - Can be a public or private address.

                          - For Linode interfaces, public IPv4 addresses or
                          public IPv6 ranges can be exchanged on public
                          interfaces. Private IPv4 addresses are not supported.
                        example: 192.0.2.1
                        format: ipv4|ipv6/prefix_length
                        type: string

                          end up with at least one public address and no more

        Configure shared IPs.


        IP sharing allows IP address reassignment (also referred to as IP
        failover) from one Linode to another if the primary Linode becomes
        unresponsive. This means that requests to the primary Linode's IP
        address can be automatically rerouted to secondary Linodes at the
        configured shared IP addresses.


        IP failover requires configuration of a [BGP based failover
        service](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/configure-failover-on-a-compute-instance)
        within the internal system of the primary Linode.


        > 📘

        >

        > A public IPv4 address can't be shared if it's configured for a 1:1 NAT
        on a legacy configuration profile VPC interface or on a Linode VPC
        interface.

        Assign multiple IPv4 addresses and/or IPv6 ranges to multiple Linodes in
        one Region. This allows swapping, shuffling, or otherwise reorganizing
        IPs to your Linodes.


        The following restrictions apply:


        - All Linodes involved must have at least one public IPv4 address after
        assignment.
          - For Linode interfaces, the Linode needs to have a public interface, and the address it receives can't be a private IPv4 address.
        - Linodes may have no more than one assigned private IPv4 address.

        - Linodes may have no more than one assigned IPv6 range.


        [Open a support
        ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket) to
        request additional IPv4 addresses or IPv6 ranges beyond standard account

        Configure shared IPs.


        IP sharing allows IP address reassignment (also referred to as IP
        failover) from one Linode to another if the primary Linode becomes
        unresponsive. This means that requests to the primary Linode's IP
        address can be automatically rerouted to secondary Linodes at the
        configured shared IP addresses.


        IP failover requires configuration of a [BGP based failover
        service](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/configure-failover-on-a-compute-instance)
        within the internal system of the primary Linode.

        Linode](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-linode-instance)
        operation to view a Linode's IPv6 SLAAC address.


        - Either `linode_id` or `route_target` is required in a request.

        - `linode_id` and `route_target` are mutually exclusive. Submitting
        values for both properties in a request results in an error.

        - Upon a successful request, an IPv6 range is created in the
        [region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions)
        that corresponds to the provided `linode_id` or `route_target`.

        - Your Linode is responsible for routing individual addresses in the
        range, or handling traffic for all the addresses in the range.

        - Run the [Assign IP
        addresses](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-assign-ips)
        operation to re-assign IPv6 Ranges to your Linodes.


        > 📘

        >

        > - A Linode can only have one IPv6 range targeting its SLAAC address.

        > - An account can only have one IPv6 range in each

        > - [Open a support
        ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket) to
        request expansion of these restrictions.

          - An IPv6 range is a `/64` or `/56` block of IPv6 addresses routed to a single Linode in a given [region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions).

          - Your Linode is responsible for routing individual addresses in the range, or handling traffic for all the addresses in the range.

          - Run the [Create an IPv6 range](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ipv6-range) operation to add a `/64` or `/56` block of IPv6 addresses to your account.

        or more Linodes that are assigned to the same VLAN, and are both within
        the same Layer 2 broadcast domain.


        For legacy configuration profile interfaces, you can use the following

        -
        [Update](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-linode-config)
        the active Configuration Profile to remove the VLAN Interface, then
        [reboot](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-reboot-linode-instance)
        the Linode.

        - [Create a config
        profile](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-add-linode-config)
        without the VLAN Interface, then
        [reboot](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-reboot-linode-instance)
        the Linode into the new Configuration Profile.

        -
        [Delete](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-linode-instance)
        the Linode.


        For Linode interfaces, you can use the following operations to create,
        attach, detach, and delete VLANs on a Linode:

        - [Create a
        Linode](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance)

        - [Add a Linode

        - [Update a Linode interface](put-linode-interface-settings)

        - [Delete a Linode
        interface](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-linode-interface)
        from a Linode.

        This operation deletes a legacy configuration profile VLAN interface. To
        delete a Linode interface VLAN, use the [Delete a Linode
        interface](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-linode-interface)
        operation.


        You can't delete a VLAN if it's still attached to a Linode. There are a
        few ways to detach it:

        -
        [Update](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-linode-config)
        the active configuration profile to remove the VLAN interface, then
        [reboot](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-reboot-linode-instance)
        the Linode.

        - [Create a config
        profile](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-add-linode-config)
        without the VLAN interface, then
        [reboot](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-reboot-linode-instance)
        the Linode into the new configuration profile.

        -
        [Delete](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-linode-instance)
        the Linode.


        To run this operation, you need `read_write` grants to Linodes that use
        the VLAN.


        A successful request triggers a `vlan_delete` event.


        > 📘

        >

        > VLANs without any attached Linodes are periodically cleaned up by the
        system.
