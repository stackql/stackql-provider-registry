              * Must begin and end with an alphanumeric character.
              * May only consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`) or periods (`.`).

                The amount of storage space, in MB, this Linode has access to. A typical Linode will divide this space between a primary disk with an `image` deployed to it, and a swap disk, usually 512 MB. This is the default configuration created when deploying a Linode with an `image` through [POST /linode/instances](/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create). While this configuration is suitable for 99% of use cases, if you need finer control over your Linode's disks, see the [/linode/instances/{linodeId}/disks](/docs/api/linode-instances/#disks-list) endpoints.

                If the average CPU usage over two hours exceeds this value, we'll send you an alert.
                Your Linode's total CPU capacity is represented as 100%, multiplied by its number of
                cores.

                For example, a two core Linode's CPU capacity is represented as 200%. If you want
                to be alerted at 90% of a two core Linode's CPU capacity, set the alert value to `180`.

                The default value is 90% multiplied by the number of cores.

                If the value is set to `0` (zero), the alert is disabled.
