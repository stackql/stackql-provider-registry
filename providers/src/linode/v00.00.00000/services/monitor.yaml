                    the Akamai Cloud `service_type`. For example, the `dbaas`
                    service returns an integer value for an `id`, that you'd use
                    for the `entity_id`, while other services may return a

                      > The format `type` for an `entity_id` may vary, based on
                      the Akamai Cloud `service_type`. For example, the `dbaas`
                      service returns an integer value for an `id`, that you'd
                      use for the `entity_id`, while other services may return a
                      string for their `id`. With the Alerts operations, all of

                        An object for describing a single error that occurred
                        during the processing of a request.
                      properties:
                        field:
                          description: >-
                            The field in the request that caused this error.
                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.
                          example: fieldname
                          type: string
                        reason:
                          description: >-
                            What happened to cause this error. In most cases,
                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data
                            you sent in the request, but in some cases you will
                            be instructed to [Open a support
                            ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket)
                            or perform some other action before you can complete
                            the request successfully.
                          example: fieldname must be a valid value
                          type: string

        __Beta__ Update an existing alert definition. Include the appropriate
        `service_type` and `alert_id` as path parameters. You need `read_only`
        access to the
        [scope](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/oauth-reference)
        for the selected `service_type`. Only include the objects in the request
        that you want to update. Leave any object out of the request to leave it
        set as is.

        > - This operation is beta. Call it using the `v4beta` path in its URL.

        >

        > - Currently, only the Managed Databases (`dbaas`) service type is
        supported.


        **User alert definitions**


        When updating an alert definition you've
        [created](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-alert-definition-for-service-type),
        you can change the `status` to `enabled` or `disabled`. You can also
        modify the `label`, `description`, `severity`, `entity_ids`,
        `rule_criteria`, `trigger_conditions`, and `channel_ids` objects. If
        updating the `entity_ids`, `rule_criteria`, or `channel_ids` list
        objects, these points apply:


        - If you want to keep an existing item, you need to include it in the
        list.


        - If you want to remove an existing item, leave it out of the list.


        - To add a new item, include it in the list.


        - You can't pass an empty list to remove all items. This doesn't apply
        to the `entity_ids` or `dimension_filters` (in `rule_criteria`) list
        objects, because they are optional, while all other list objects are
        required.


        **System alert definitions**


        These are the default alert definitions offered by Akamai. You can only
        edit the `entity_ids` list object for these alerts. All of the points
        above regarding editing a list object apply here, too. __OAuth scopes__.

                    >

                    > - The format `type` for an `entity_id` may vary, based on
                    the Akamai Cloud `service_type`. For example, the `dbaas`
                    service returns an integer value for an `id`, that you'd use
                    for the `entity_id`, while other services may return a
                    string for their `id`. With the Alerts operations, all of
                    these formats are recognized as an `entity_id`, when you
                    include them as a `string`.

                    - '13116'

                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.

                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data
                            you sent in the request, but in some cases you will
                            be instructed to [Open a support

                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.

                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data
                            you sent in the request, but in some cases you will
                            be instructed to [Open a support
