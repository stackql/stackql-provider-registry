                      countries. Set to an empty string (`""`) if a TIN doesn't

        account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
        environment, the following apply:


        - You can't change the `company` for a parent account. Akamai uses this
        value to set the name for a child account parent user (proxy user) on
        any child account.


        - Child account users can't run this operation. These users don't have
        access to billing-related operations.

        __Parent and child accounts__


        In a [parent and child
        account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
        environment, the following apply:


        - A child account user can't remove a child account.


        - You can't remove a parent account if it has an active child account.


        - You need to work with your Akamai account team to dissolve any
        parent-child account relationships before you can fully remove a child
        or parent account.

    post:
      description: >-
        Create a short-lived bearer token for a parent user on a child account,
        using the `euuid` of that child account. In the context of the API, a
        parent user on a child account is referred to as a "proxy user." When
        Akamai provisions your parent-child account environment, a proxy user is
        automatically set in the child account. It follows a specific naming
        convention:

            <Parent account `company` name>_<SHA256 hash of parent `company` name and child account `euuid`>

        > 📘

        >

        > These variables only use the first 15 and 16 characters of these
        values, respectively.


        The token lets a parent account run API operations through the proxy
        user, as if they are a child user in the child account.


        These points apply to the use of this operation:


        - To create a token, a parent account user needs the
        `child_account_access` grant. This lets them use the proxy user on the
        child account. You can run [List a user's
        grants](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-user-grants)
        on a parent account user to check its `child_account_access` setting. To
        add this access, you can
        [update](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-user-grants)
        the parent account user.


        - The created token inherits the permissions of the proxy user. It will
        never have less.


        - The API returns the raw token in the response. You can't get it again,
        so be sure to store it.


        Example workflow:


        1. [List child
        accounts](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-child-accounts)
        and store the `euuid` for the applicable one.

        2. Run this operation and store the `token` that's created for the proxy
        user.

        3. As a parent account user with access to the proxy user in the child
        account, use this `token` to authenticate API operations, as if you were
        a child user.

                            with the following parameters:


                            - A single value in date-time string format
                            (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`), which returns only matches to
                            that value.


                            - A dictionary containing pairs of inequality
                            operator string keys (`+or`, `+gt`, `+gte`, `+lt`,
                            `+lte`, or `+neq`) and single date-time string
                            format values (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S`). `+or` accepts
                            an array of values that may consist of single

        have an important ticket open, you can respond to that ticket to dismiss
        its notification.

                      properties:
                        field:
                          description: >-
                            The field in the request that caused this error.
                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.
                          example: fieldname
                          type: string
                        reason:
                          description: >-
                            What happened to cause this error. In most cases,
                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data
                            you sent in the request, but in some cases you will
                            be instructed to [Open a support

                            the request successfully.
                          example: fieldname must be a valid value
                          type: string

        Adds a Payment Method to your Account with the option to set it as the
        default method.


        - Adding a default Payment Method removes the default status from any
        other Payment Method.


        - An Account can have up to 6 active Payment Methods.


        - Up to 60 Payment Methods can be added each day.


        - Prior to adding a Payment Method, ensure that your billing address
        information is up-to-date with a valid `zip` by running the [Update your
        account](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-account)
        operation.


        - A `payment_method_add` event is generated when a payment is
        successfully submitted.


        __Parent and child accounts__


        In a [parent and child
        account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
        environment, the following apply:


        - Child account users can't run this operation. These users don't have

                      properties:
                        field:
                          description: >-
                            The field in the request that caused this error.
                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.

        Creates a transfer request for the specified services. A request can
        contain any of the specified service types and any number of each
        service type. At this time, only Linodes can be transferred.


        When created successfully, a confirmation email is sent to the account
        that created this transfer containing a transfer token and instructions
        on completing the transfer.


        When a transfer is
        [accepted](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-accept-service-transfer),
        the requested services are moved to the receiving account. Linode
        services will not experience interruptions due to the transfer process.
        Backups for Linodes are transferred as well.


        DNS records that are associated with requested services will not be
        transferred or updated. Please ensure that associated DNS records have
        been updated or communicated to the recipient prior to the transfer.


        A transfer can take up to three hours to complete once accepted. When a
        transfer is completed, billing for transferred services ends for the
        sending account and begins for the receiving account.


        This operation can only be accessed by the unrestricted users of an
        account.


        There are several conditions that you need to meet to successfully
        create a transfer request:


        1. The account creating the transfer can't have a past due balance or
        active Terms of Service violation.


        1. The service needs to be owned by the account that is creating the
        transfer.


        1. The service can't be assigned to another Service Transfer that is
        pending or that's been accepted and is incomplete.


        1. Linodes can't:

            - be assigned to a NodeBalancer, Firewall, VLAN, VPC, or Managed Service.

            - have any attached Block Storage Volumes.

            - have any shared IP addresses.

            - have any assigned /32, /56, /64, or /116 IPv6 ranges.

        Accept a Service Transfer for the provided token to receive the services
        included in the transfer to your account. At this time, only Linodes can
        be transferred.


        When accepted, email confirmations are sent to the accounts that created
        and accepted the transfer. A transfer can take up to three hours to
        complete once accepted. Once a transfer is completed, billing for
        transferred services ends for the sending account and begins for the
        receiving account.


        This operation can only be accessed by the unrestricted users of the
        account that receives the transfer. Users of the same account that
        created a transfer cannot accept the transfer.


        There are several conditions that must be met in order to accept a
        transfer request:


        1. Only transfers with a `pending` status can be accepted.


        1. The account accepting the transfer must have a registered payment
        method and must not have a past due balance or other account limitations
        for the services to be transferred.


        1. Both the account that created the transfer and the account that is
        accepting the transfer must not have any active Terms of Service
        violations.


        1. The service must still be owned by the account that created the
        transfer.


        1. Linodes must not:

            - be assigned to a NodeBalancer, Firewall, VLAN, or Managed Service.

            - have any attached Block Storage Volumes.

            - have any shared IP addresses.

            - have any assigned /56, /64, or /116 IPv6 ranges.

        Any and all of the above conditions must be cured and maintained by the
        relevant account prior to the transfer's expiration to allow the
        transfer to be accepted by the receiving account.

        __Parent and child accounts__


        In a [parent and child
        account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
        environment, the following apply:


        - A parent account user can create new parent account users.


        - A child account can
        [update](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/put-user) the
        child account parent user (proxy user) to `unrestricted`. This gives the
        proxy user access to create new child account users.


        - A child account user can create new child account users.


        - You can't create a proxy user. The proxy user in a child account is
        predefined when you initially provision the parent-child relationship.

                          account. A parent account user with the

        environment, the following apply:


        - You can't edit the `username` or `email` values for the child account
        parent user (proxy user). These are predefined for the proxy user when
        you initially provision the parent-child relationship. Only a proxy
        user's `restricted` status can be modified. This can only be done by an
        unrestricted child account user.


        - A parent account using an unrestricted proxy user in a child account
        can modify the `username`, `email`, and `restricted` status for an
        existing child account user.


        - A restricted account user--parent or child--can't change their user to
        `unrestricted`.

                          respective account. Possible values include:


                          - `parent`. This is a user in an Akamai partner
                          account. Akamai partners have a contractural
                          relationship with their end customers, to sell Akamai
                          services. This user can either have full access (a
                          parent account admin user) or limited access. Limited
                          users don't have access to manage child accounts, but
                          they can be granted this access by an admin user.


                          - `child`. This is an Akamai partner's end customer
                          user, in a child account. A child user can have either
                          full or limited access. Full access lets the user
                          manage other child users and the proxy user in a child
                          account.


                          - `proxy`. This is a user on a child account that
                          gives parent account users access to that child
                          account. A parent account user with the
                          `child_account_access` grant can [Create a proxy user

                          token to run API operations from the child account, as
                          if they were a child user.


                          - `default`. This applies to all regular,

                          > A `restricted` user can't be used to manage users,
                          even if this is set to `read-write`. Only unrestricted
                          users can manage other users on an account.

                          account user, to give the user `read-write` access.
                          This gives the child user unrestricted access to
                          expected management operations, such as creating other
                          child users. However, child users don't have write
                          access to billing operations. The API issues a
                          specific error message if a write operation is
                          attempted by a child user.

        In a [parent and child
        account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
        environment, the following apply:


        - No child account user can modify the `account_access` grant for the
        child account parent user (proxy user).


        - An unrestricted child account user can configure all other grants for
        the proxy user, with the `global` object.


        - An unrestricted child account user can enable the `account_access`
        grant for other child account users. However, enabled child users are
        still subject to child user restrictions--they can't perform write
        operations for any billing or account information. __OAuth scopes__.

                        > A `restricted` user can't be used to manage users,
                        even if this is set to `read-write`. Only unrestricted

                        user, to give the user `read-write` access. This gives

                        management operations, such as creating other child

                        billing operations. The API issues a specific error
                        message if a write operation is attempted by a child
                        user.

                          > A `restricted` user can't be used to manage users,
                          even if this is set to `read-write`. Only unrestricted
                          users can manage other users on an account.

                          In a [parent and child

                          environment, this grant can be added to a child
                          account user, to give the user `read-write` access.
                          This gives the child user unrestricted access to
                          expected management operations, such as creating other
                          child users. However, child users don't have write
                          access to billing operations. The API issues a
                          specific error message if a write operation is
                          attempted by a child user.
