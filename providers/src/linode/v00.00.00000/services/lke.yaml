        Creates a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster will be created
        asynchronously. You can use the events system to determine when the
        Kubernetes cluster is ready to use. Please note that it often takes 2-5
        minutes before the [Kubernetes API
        endpoints](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-lke-cluster-api-endpoints)
        and the [Kubeconfig
        file](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-lke-cluster-kubeconfig)
        for the new cluster are ready.

                      - UTF-8 characters will be returned by the API using escape sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the Japanese character _か_ is 3 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xE382AB`). Its Unicode code point is 2 bytes (`0x30AB`). APIv4 supports this character and the API will return it as the escape sequence using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode code point (`"\u30ab"`).

                      - 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.

                      - If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte characters.

                          **Label key:**


                          - A key can contain alphanumeric characters, dashes
                          (`-`), underscores (`_`), or dots (`.`). Start and end
                          it with an alphanumeric character.


                          - If the key begins with a DNS subdomain prefix
                          followed by a single slash, for example
                          `example.com/my-app`, the maximum total length of the
                          label key is 128 characters. Domain labels can be up
                          to 62 characters after the '/'. The prefix needs to
                          adhere to [RFC
                          1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123)
                          DNS subdomain restrictions.


                          - If the key doesn't begin with a DNS subdomain
                          prefix, the maximum key length is 63 characters.


                          Specifying an empty object removes all previously set
                          labels.


                          **Label value:**


                          - The label's value can contain alphanumeric
                          characters, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), or dots
                          (`.`). Start and end it with an alphanumeric
                          character.


                          - Can be specified as an empty string value with `""`.

                        - UTF-8 characters will be returned by the API using escape sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the Japanese character _か_ is 3 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xE382AB`). Its Unicode code point is 2 bytes (`0x30AB`). APIv4 supports this character and the API will return it as the escape sequence using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode code point (`"\u30ab"`).

                        - 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.

                        - If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte characters.

                        - UTF-8 characters will be returned by the API using escape sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the Japanese character _か_ is 3 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xE382AB`). Its Unicode code point is 2 bytes (`0x30AB`). APIv4 supports this character and the API will return it as the escape sequence using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode code point (`"\u30ab"`).

                        - 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.

                        - If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte characters.

                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data

                    High Availability (HA) and an IP-based Access Control List
                    (ACL) for the control plane components.


                    When upgrading pre-existing LKE clusters to use the HA
                    Control Plane, the following changes will additionally
                    occur:


                    - All nodes will be deleted and new nodes will be created to
                    replace them.


                    - Any local storage (such as `hostPath` volumes) will be
                    erased.


                    - The upgrade process may take several minutes to complete,
                    as nodes will be replaced on a rolling basis.


                    When upgrading pre-existing LKE clusters to use the control
                    plane ACL for the first time, it may take several hours for
                    external clients to respect the access control settings.
                    This is partly due to delays from DNS propagation.

                    When upgrading the Kubernetes version, only the next latest
                    minor version following the current version can be deployed.
                    For example, a cluster with Kubernetes version 1.29 can be

        - Deletes all supporting Kubernetes services for this Kubernetes cluster
        (API server, etcd, etc)

        - Deletes all NodeBalancers created by this Kubernetes cluster

        - Does not delete any of the volumes created by this Kubernetes cluster

                        Domain labels can be up to 62 characters after the '/'.
                        The prefix needs to adhere to [RFC

                    Key-value pairs added as labels to nodes in the node pool.
                    Labels help classify your nodes and easily select subsets of
                    objects. To learn more, review [Add Labels and Taints to
                    your LKE node
                    pools](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/kubernetes/guides/deploy-and-manage-cluster-with-the-linode-api/#add-labels-and-taints-to-your-lke-node-pools).


                    **Label key:**


                    - A key can contain alphanumeric characters, dashes (`-`),
                    underscores (`_`), or dots (`.`). Start and end it with an
                    alphanumeric character.


                    - If the key begins with a DNS subdomain prefix followed by
                    a single slash, for example `example.com/my-app`, the
                    maximum total length of the label key is 128 characters.
                    Domain labels can be up to 62 characters after the '/'. The
                    prefix needs to adhere to [RFC
                    1123](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123) DNS
                    subdomain restrictions.


                    - If the key doesn't begin with a DNS subdomain prefix, the
                    maximum key length is 63 characters.


                    Specifying an empty object removes all previously set
                    labels.


                    **Label value:**


                    - The label's value can contain alphanumeric characters,
                    dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), or dots (`.`). Start and
                    end it with an alphanumeric character.


                    - Can be specified as an empty string value with `""`.
                  example:
                    example.com/my-app: teams

        Regenerate the Kubeconfig file and/or the service account token for a

        This is a helper operation that allows performing both the [Delete a
        Kubeconfig](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-lke-cluster-kubeconfig)
        and the [Delete a service
        token](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-lke-service-token)
        operations with a single request.


        When using this operation, at least one of `kubeconfig` or
        `servicetoken` is required.


        > 📘

        >

        > When regenerating a service account token, the cluster's control plane
        components and Linode CSI drivers are also restarted and configured with
        the new token. High availability clusters shouldn't experience any
        disruption, while standard clusters may experience brief control plane
        downtime while components are restarted.

        > When you regenerate a service account token, the cluster's control
        plane components and Linode CSI drivers are also restarted and
        configured with the new token. High availability clusters shouldn't
        experience any disruption, while standard clusters may experience brief
        control plane downtime while components are restarted.
