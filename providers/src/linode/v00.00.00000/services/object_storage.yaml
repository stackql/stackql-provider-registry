        Creates an Object Storage bucket in the specified data center
        ([region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions)).
        If the bucket already exists on your account, this operation returns a
        200 response with that bucket as if the API just created it.

                    * A bucket name can contain from 3 to 63 alphanumeric
                    characters, dashes (`-`), or dots (`.`).

                    * A bucket name can't end in a dash and you can't use two
                    consecutive dashes.

                    * A bucket name can't start or end in a dot, and you can't
                    use two consecutive dots. As a best practice, only use dots
                    if a certificate you're using with your bucket requires it.
                    (For example, if you're using a custom TLS certificate.)

                    * A bucket name needs to be unique in the `region` where
                    you're creating the bucket. The API only reserves labels for

        > - You need to remove all objects from a bucket before you can delete
        it. While you can delete a bucket using the
        [CLI](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage/guides/s3cmd/#delete-a-bucket),
        this operation fails if the bucket contains too many objects. The best
        way to empty large buckets is to configure lifecycle policies with an
        outside API, such as the [Ceph Object Gateway S3
        API](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/radosgw/bucketpolicy/#). Set a
        policy to remove all objects, wait a day or more for the system to
        remove all objects, then delete the bucket.

        **Create an unlimited access key**


        This type of key grants full access to all of your buckets in each
        region you name, using the `regions` array. Run the [List
        regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions)
        operation, verify that each desired region includes `"Object Storage"`
        among its `capabilities`, and store the `id` value for each. Leave the
        `bucket_access` array out to create an unlimited access key.


        Check out this [example
        workflow](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/create-an-unlimited-access-key)
        for an unlimited access key.


        **Create a limited access key**


        This type of key lets you name specific buckets where you need to manage
        content. In the `bucket_access` array, include individual objects for
        each bucket, comprised of the target `bucket_name`, the `permissions`
        level for access to the bucket, and the `region` where the bucket lives.
        Run the [List Object Storage
        buckets](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-object-storage-buckets)
        operation and store the `label`, to use as the `bucket_name`, and the
        `region` for each. With a limited access key, the parent-level `regions`
        array isn't required.


        Check out this [example
        workflow](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/create-a-limited-access-key)
        for a limited access key.

                        An object for describing a single error that occurred
                        during the processing of a request.

                            The field in the request that caused this error.
                            This may be a path, separated by periods in the case
                            of nested fields. In some cases this may come back
                            as `null` if the error is not specific to any single
                            element of the request.
                          example: fieldname

                            What happened to cause this error. In most cases,
                            this can be fixed immediately by changing the data
                            you sent in the request, but in some cases you will
                            be instructed to [Open a support
                            ticket](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-ticket)

                            the request successfully.
                          example: fieldname must be a valid value
                          type: string
