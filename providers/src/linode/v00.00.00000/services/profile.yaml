                  A profile represents your user in our system. This is where
                  you can change information about your user. This information
                  is available to any OAuth client regardless of requested
                  scopes, and you can use it to populate user information in
                  third-party applications.

                      and Akamai authorizes it when you log into your account.
                      Authentication types include your user's password (in

                      identity provider, such as GitHub. Here are some examples:


                      - If a user has never used third-party authentication, the
                      authentication type will be `password`.


                      - If a user is using third-party authentication, the name
                      of their identity provider is used for the authentication
                      type, for example, `github`.


                      - If a user has used third-party authentication and has
                      since revoked it, the authentication type is `password`.

        This returns a GrantsResponse describing what the acting User has been
        granted access to.  For unrestricted users, this will return a  204 and
        no body because unrestricted users have access to everything without
        grants.  This will not return information about entities you do not have
        access to.  This operation is useful when writing third-party OAuth
        applications to see what options you should present to the acting User.


        For example, if they do not have `global.add_linodes`, you might not
        display a button to deploy a new Linode.


        Any client may run this operation; no OAuth scopes are required.

                          > A `restricted` user can't be used to manage users,
                          even if this is set to `read-write`. Only unrestricted
                          users can manage other users on an account.


                          __Parent and child accounts__


                          In a [parent and child
                          account](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/parent-child-accounts/)
                          environment, this grant can be added to a child
                          account user, to give the user `read-write` access.
                          This gives the child user unrestricted access to
                          expected management operations, such as creating other
                          child users. However, child users don't have write
                          access to billing operations. The API issues a
                          specific error message if a write operation is
                          attempted by a child user.

        Send a one-time verification code via SMS message to the submitted phone

        is only used to verify your identity by sending an SMS message. Standard
        carrier messaging fees may apply.


        - By accessing this operation you are opting in to receive SMS messages.
        You can opt out of SMS messages by running the [Delete a phone

        operation after your phone number is verified.


        - Verification codes are valid for 10 minutes after they are sent.


        - Subsequent requests made prior to code expiration result in sending
        the same code.


        Once a verification code is received, verify your phone number with the

        - Verification codes are valid for 10 minutes after they are sent.


        - Only the same User that made the verification code request can use
        that code with this operation.


        Once completed, the verified phone number is assigned to the User making
        the request. To change the verified phone number for a User, first run
        the [Delete a phone
        number](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-profile-phone-number)
        operation, then begin the verification process again with the [Send a

        - If you're using a child account parent user (proxy user), you can't
        create this form of token. The only token available to a proxy user is
        one that lets you run operations in a child account. These are created
        with the [Create a proxy user

                  the Linode CLI, or when writing your own integrations.

                the API without going through an OAuth login.  Personal Access
