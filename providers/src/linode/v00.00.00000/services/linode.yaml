      description: "Creates a Linode Instance on your Account. In order for this request\
        \ to complete successfully, your User must have the `add_linodes` grant. Creating\
        \ a new Linode will incur a charge on your Account.\n\nLinodes can be created\
        \ using one of the available Types. Run [List Linode types](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-linode-types)\
        \ to get more information about each Type's specs and cost.\n\nLinodes can\
        \ be created in any one of our available Regions, which are accessible from\
        \ the [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions)\
        \ operation.\n\nIn an effort to fight spam, Linode restricts outbound connections\
        \ on ports 25, 465, and 587 on all Linodes for new accounts created after\
        \ November 5th, 2019. For more information, see our guide on [Running a Mail\
        \ Server](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/running-a-mail-server/).\n\n\
        __Important__. You must be an unrestricted User in order to add or modify\
        \ tags on Linodes.\n\nLinodes can be created in a number of ways:\n\n- Using\
        \ a Linode Public Image distribution or a Private Image you created based\
        \ on another Linode.\n\n  - Run the [List images](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-images)\
        \ operation with authentication to view all available Images.\n\n  - The Linode\
        \ will be `running` after it completes `provisioning`.\n  - A default config\
        \ with two Disks, one being a 512 swap disk, is created.\n    - `swap_size`\
        \ can be used to customize the swap disk size.\n  - Requires a `root_pass`\
        \ be supplied to use for the root User's Account.\n  - It is recommended to\
        \ supply SSH keys for the root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n \
        \ - You may also supply a list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n\
        \    - These users must have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first.\
        \ See the [Add an SSH key](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-add-ssh-key))\
        \ operation for more information.\n\n- Using cloud-init with [Metadata](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata/).\n\
        \  - Automate system configuration and software installation by providing\
        \ a base-64 encoded [cloud-config](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/metadata-cloud-config/)\
        \ file.\n  - Requires a compatible Image. You can determine compatible Images\
        \ by checking for `cloud-init` under `capabilities` when running [List images](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-images).\n\
        \  - Requires a compatible Region.  You can determine compatible Regions by\
        \ checking for `Metadata` under `capabilities` when running [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions).\n\
        \n- Using a StackScript.\n\n  - Run [List StackScripts](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-stack-scripts)\
        \ for a list of available StackScripts.\n  - The Linode will be `running`\
        \ after it completes `provisioning`.\n  - Requires a compatible Image to be\
        \ supplied.\n    - Run [Get a StackScript](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-stack-script)\
        \ for compatible Images.\n  - Requires a `root_pass` be supplied to use for\
        \ the root User's Account.\n  - It is recommended to supply SSH keys for the\
        \ root User using the `authorized_keys` field.\n  - You may also supply a\
        \ list of usernames via the `authorized_users` field.\n    - These users must\
        \ have an SSH Key associated with your Profile first. See [Add an SSH key](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-add-ssh-key)\
        \ for more information.\n\n- Using one of your other Linode's backups.\n \
        \ - You must create a Linode large enough to accommodate the Backup's size.\n\
        \  - The Disks and Config will match that of the Linode that was backed up.\n\
        \  - The `root_pass` will match that of the Linode that was backed up.\n\n\
        - Attached to a private VLAN.\n  - Review the `interfaces` property of the\
        \ [Request Body Schema](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance)\
        \ for details.\n  - For more information, see our guide on [Getting Started\
        \ with VLANs](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/get-started/).\n\
        \n- Create an empty Linode.\n  - The Linode will remain `offline` and must\
        \ be manually started.\n    - Run [Boot a Linode](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-boot-linode-instance).\n\
        \  - Disks and Configs must be created manually.\n  - This is only recommended\
        \ for advanced use cases.\n\nDepending on your [account settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-account-settings),\
        \ you can choose between legacy configuration interfaces or Linode interfaces\
        \ when creating a Linode. Only one type of interface is allowed per Linode.\
        \ The `interface_generation` field lets you select one interface type for\
        \ new Linodes when both legacy and Linode interfaces options are available\
        \ on your account. If a Linode is configured with a Linode interface, legacy\
        \ configuration interfaces can no longer be used on that Linode.\n\n[Learn\

                                For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                                - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                                - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                                to the `public` interface.


                                - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first
                                or `eth0` position to be reachable via the public
                                internet, after it boots. If no `public` interface
                                is configured, you can only access the Linode through
                                [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                                or through another Linode that''s connected to the
                                same VLAN or VPC.


                                For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                                - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches
                                a Linode to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                                - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses
                                this address.


                                For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                                - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches
                                a Linode to an existing VPC subnet with the specified
                                `subnet_id`.


                                - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                                to use an IP address from the range in the assigned
                                VPC subnet. See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.'

                          Linode''s CPU capacity, set the alert value to `180`.


                          The default value is 90% multiplied by the number of cores.


                          If the value is set to `0` (zero), the alert is disabled.'

                      It works by issuing a boot job when your Linode powers off without
                      a shutdown job being responsible. To prevent a loop, Lassie
                      gives up if there have been more than 5 boot jobs issued within

      description: "Restores a Linode's backup to the specified Linode.\n\n- Backups\
        \ may not be restored across regions.\n- Only successfully completed backups\
        \ that are not undergoing maintenance can be restored.\n- The Linode that\
        \ the backup is being restored to can't be the target of a current backup.\n\
        \nWhen you restore a backup, the restored disk is assigned the same [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)\
        \ as the original disk. In most cases, this is acceptable and doesn't cause\
        \ issues. However, if you try to mount both the original disk and the corresponding\
        \ restore disk at the same time (by assigning them both to devices in your\
        \ Configuration Profile's __Block Device Assignment__), you'll encounter a\
        \ UUID \"collision\".\n\nWhen this happens, the system selects, and mounts,\
        \ only one of the disks at random. This is because both disks are sharing\
        \ the same UUID. Your instance _may fail to boot_ because the API can't tell\
        \ which disk is root. If your system boots in this scenario, you won't see\
        \ an immediate indication if you're booted into the restored disk or the original\
        \ disk, and you'll be unable to access both disks at the same time.\n\nTo\
        \ avoid this, only restore a backup to the same Linode if you don't intend\
        \ to mount them at the same time, or you're comfortable modifying UUIDs. If\
        \ you need access to files on both the original disk and the restored disk\
        \ simultaneously -- for example, if you need to copy files between them --\
        \ you should restore the backup to a separate Linode or [create](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/post-linode-instance)\
        \ a new Linode using the desired `backup_id`.\n\nTo learn more about block\
        \ device assignments and viewing your disks' UUIDs, see our guide on [Configuration\
        \ Profiles](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/configuration-profiles/#block-device-assignment).\n\
        \n> \U0001F4D8\n>\n> Backups aren't encrypted even when they're taken from\
        \ an encrypted disk. When a backup is restored, and if encryption is enabled,\
        \ the data stored on the disk is encrypted again.\n\n[Learn more...](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/getting-started-with-the-linode-cli)\n\

        used.

      description: 'You can clone your Linode''s existing disks, configuration profiles
        and interfaces to another Linode on your account. In order for this request
        to complete successfully, you need the `add_linodes` grant.


        For Linodes using Linode interfaces, the clone needs to be located in a region
        that supports Linode interfaces (see [GET a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region)).
        The [account settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-account-settings)
        need to allow creation of Linodes with Linode interfaces.


        Cloning to a new Linode incurs a charge on your account.


        If cloning to an existing Linode, any actions currently running or queued
        must be completed first before you can clone to it.


        Up to five clone operations from any given source Linode can be run concurrently.
        If more concurrent clones are attempted, an HTTP 400 error will be returned
        by this operation.


        Any [tags](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-tags) existing
        on the source Linode will be cloned to the target Linode.


        Linodes utilizing Metadata (`"has_user_data": true`) must be cloned to a new
        Linode with `metadata.user_data` included with the clone request.


        `vpc` details


        - If the Linode you''re cloning has a `vpc` interface on its active legacy
        configuration profile that includes a 1:1 NAT, the resulting clone is configured
        with an `any` 1:1 NAT.

        - See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications)
        guide for its specifications and limitations.


        `vlan` details


        - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. If a VLAN
        is attached to your Linode and you attempt clone it to a non-NGN data center,
        the cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be cloned because of an
        incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a different data center or
        contact support.

        - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications)
        guide to view additional specifications and limitations.

                    Consider these points when cloning:


                    - If the Linode you''re cloning exists in a placement group, the
                    API won''t automatically add the cloned instance to the same placement
                    group. You need to specify a placement group to add the clone
                    to.


                    - The target placement group needs to be in the same `region`
                    set for this Linode.


                    - The placement group needs to have capacity. Run the [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region)
                    operation and note either the `maximum_linodes_per_pg` (strict)
                    or `maximum_linodes_per_flexible_pg` (flexible), based on your
                    selected `placement_group_policy`. These represent the Linode
                    limit per placement group, for each `placement_group_policy` type.
                    You can then run the [Get a placement group](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-placement-group)
                    operation to review the Linodes in that group.'

                      mode, its status is `stopped`. Status is generally self-explanatory,
                      based on its name.

                      completes, the API completes the assignment and updates the
                      compute instance''s `status` accordingly.

                      - `provisioning` indicates that the API is applying operating
                      system or Marketplace applications on the compute instance.

                            - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                            to the `public` interface.


                            - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or
                            `eth0` position to be reachable via the public internet,
                            after it boots. If no `public` interface is configured,

                            or through another Linode that''s connected to the same
                            VLAN or VPC.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                            - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses
                            this address.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                            - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                            to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC

                      - `linode/latest-64bit`. This is the default, our latest kernel
                      at the time of an instance boot or reboot.


                      - `linode/grub2`. The upstream distribution-supplied kernel
                      that''s installed on the primary disk, or a custom kernel if
                      installed.


                      - `linode/direct-disk`. The master boot record (MBR) of the
                      primary disk or root device. Use this in place of a Linux kernel.'

                            - Required.


                            - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces.
                            A Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple
                            times.


                            - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes
                            (`-`). You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                            - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10
                            VLANs can be created in each data center `region`. To
                            view your active VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)

                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                            - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                            - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                            to the `public` interface.


                            - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or
                            `eth0` position to be reachable via the public internet,
                            after it boots. If no `public` interface is configured,
                            you can only access the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                            or through another Linode that''s connected to the same
                            VLAN or VPC.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                            - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses
                            this address.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                            - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                            to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC
                            subnet. See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.'

                                  - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces.
                                  A Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple
                                  times.


                                  - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers,

                                  - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up
                                  to 10 VLANs can be created in each data center `region`.

                                  For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                                  - You can only define one `public` interface per
                                  Linode.


                                  - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                                  to the `public` interface.


                                  - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first
                                  or `eth0` position to be reachable via the public
                                  internet, after it boots. If no `public` interface
                                  is configured, you can only access the Linode through
                                  [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                                  or through another Linode that''s connected to the
                                  same VLAN or VPC.


                                  For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                                  - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches
                                  a Linode to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                                  - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode
                                  uses this address.


                                  For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                                  - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches
                                  a Linode to an existing VPC subnet with the specified

                                  - When the interface is activated, the Linode is

                            - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces.
                            A Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple
                            times.


                            - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes
                            (`-`). You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                            - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10
                            VLANs can be created in each data center `region`. To
                            view your active VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)
                            operation.

                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                            - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                            - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                            to the `public` interface.


                            - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or
                            `eth0` position to be reachable via the public internet,
                            after it boots. If no `public` interface is configured,
                            you can only access the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                            or through another Linode that''s connected to the same
                            VLAN or VPC.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                            - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses
                            this address.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                            - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                            to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC
                            subnet. See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.'

                          A Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple times.

                          For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                          - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                          - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                          to the `public` interface.


                          - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                          position to be reachable via the public internet, after
                          it boots. If no `public` interface is configured, you can

                          VLAN or VPC.


                          For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                          - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                          to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                          - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this
                          address.


                          For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                          - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                          to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                          - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                          to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC

                            - Required.


                            - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces.
                            A Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple
                            times.


                            - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes
                            (`-`). You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                            - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10
                            VLANs can be created in each data center `region`. To
                            view your active VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)

                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                            - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                            - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned
                            to the `public` interface.


                            - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or
                            `eth0` position to be reachable via the public internet,
                            after it boots. If no `public` interface is configured,
                            you can only access the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                            or through another Linode that''s connected to the same
                            VLAN or VPC.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                            - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses
                            this address.


                            For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                            - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                            to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                            - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                            to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC
                            subnet. See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.'

        for the Linode.


        - A successful request triggers a `linode_config_update` [event](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-events).


        - Only one interface can be set as `primary`. Setting `primary` to `true`
        for an interface sets all other interfaces to `false`.

                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                      - Required.


                      - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces. A Linode
                      can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple times.


                      - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`).
                      You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                      - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10 VLANs
                      can be created in each data center `region`. To view your active
                      VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)
                      operation.


                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                      - If you include this in a request, set it to an empty string
                      (`""`) or `null`.

                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                      - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                      - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned to the
                      `public` interface.


                      - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                      position to be reachable via the public internet, after it boots.
                      If no `public` interface is configured, you can only access
                      the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                      or through another Linode that''s connected to the same VLAN

                      - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                      to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                      - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                      to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet.

                      `public` interface.


                      - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                      position to be reachable via the public internet, after it boots.
                      If no `public` interface is configured, you can only access
                      the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                      or through another Linode that''s connected to the same VLAN

                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                      - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                      to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                      - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this address.

                      - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                      to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                      - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                      to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet.

                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                        - Required.


                        - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces. A
                        Linode can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple times.


                        - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes
                        (`-`). You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                        - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10 VLANs
                        can be created in each data center `region`. To view your
                        active VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)
                        operation.


                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                        - If you include this in a request, set it to an empty string
                        (`""`) or `null`.


                        - Returned as `null` in a response.


                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                        - If you include this in a request, set it to an empty string
                        (`""`) or `null`.

                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                        - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                        - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned to
                        the `public` interface.


                        - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                        position to be reachable via the public internet, after it
                        boots. If no `public` interface is configured, you can only
                        access the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                        or through another Linode that''s connected to the same VLAN
                        or VPC.


                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                        - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                        to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                        - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this
                        address.


                        For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                        - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                        to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                        - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                        to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet.
                        See `ipv4.vpc` for more information.'

                      - Required.


                      - This needs to be unique among a Linode''s interfaces. A Linode
                      can''t be attached to the same VLAN multiple times.


                      - This can only contain ASCII letters, numbers, and dashes (`-`).
                      You can''t use two consecutive dashes (`--`).


                      - If the VLAN label is new, a VLAN is created. Up to 10 VLANs
                      can be created in each data center `region`. To view your active
                      VLANs, run the [List VLANs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-vlans)

                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                      - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                      - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned to the
                      `public` interface.


                      - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                      position to be reachable via the public internet, after it boots.
                      If no `public` interface is configured, you can only access
                      the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                      or through another Linode that''s connected to the same VLAN
                      or VPC.


                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                      - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                      to the VLAN with the specified `label`.


                      - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this address.


                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                      - Configuring this `purpose` of interface attaches a Linode
                      to an existing VPC subnet with the specified `subnet_id`.


                      - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                      to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet.

                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `public`:


                      - You can only define one `public` interface per Linode.


                      - The Linode''s default public IPv4 address is assigned to the
                      `public` interface.


                      - A Linode needs a `public` interface in the first or `eth0`
                      position to be reachable via the public internet, after it boots.
                      If no `public` interface is configured, you can only access
                      the Linode through [LISH](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/lish/),
                      or through another Linode that''s connected to the same VLAN
                      or VPC.


                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vlan`:


                      - The target Linode is attached to the VLAN with the specified
                      `label`.


                      - If an `ipam_address` is configured, the Linode uses this address.


                      For interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`:


                      - The target Linode is attached to an existing VPC subnet with
                      the specified `subnet_id`.


                      - When the interface is activated, the Linode is configured
                      to use an IP address from the range in the assigned VPC subnet.

        The Disk must not be in use. If the Disk is in use, the request will succeed
        but the resize will ultimately fail. For a request to succeed, the Linode
        must be shut down prior to resizing the Disk, or the Disk must not be assigned
        to the Linode''s active Configuration Profile.


        If you are resizing the Disk to a smaller size, it cannot be made smaller
        than what is required by the total size of the files current on the Disk.

                                        or ports affected by this rule:


                                        - The string may be a single port, a range
                                        of ports, or a comma-separated list of single
                                        ports and port ranges. A space is permitted
                                        following each comma.

                                        - A range of ports is inclusive of the start
                                        and end values for the range. The end value
                                        of the range must be greater than the start
                                        value.

                                        - Ports must be within 1 and 65535, and may
                                        not contain any leading zeroes. For example,
                                        port `080` is not allowed.

                                        - The ports string can have up to 15 _pieces_,
                                        where a single port is treated as one piece,
                                        and a port range is treated as two pieces.
                                        For example, the string "22-24, 80, 443" has
                                        four pieces.

                                        - If no ports are configured, all ports are
                                        affected.

                                        - Only allowed for the TCP and UDP protocols.
                                        Ports are not allowed for the ICMP and IPENCAP

      description: 'Initiate a pending host migration that has been scheduled by Linode
        or initiate a cross data center (DC) migration.  A list of pending migrations,
        if any, can be accessed from [List notifications](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-notifications).
        When the migration begins, your Linode will be shutdown if not already off.
        If the migration initiated the shutdown, it will reboot the Linode when completed.


        To initiate a cross DC migration, you must pass a `region` parameter to the
        request body specifying the target data center region. You can view a list
        of all available regions and their feature capabilities from [List regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions).
        See our [Pricing Page](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) for Region-specific
        pricing, which applies after migration is complete. If your Linode has a DC
        migration already queued or you have initiated a previously scheduled migration,
        you will not be able to initiate a DC migration until it has completed.


        `vpc` details


        - Cross DC migrations don''t work for Linodes that have a `vpc` purpose legacy
        configuration interface or a VPC Linode interface. They work for host migrations
        within the same DC.

        - See the [VPC documentation](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vpc/#technical-specifications)
        guide for its specifications and limitations.


        `vlan` details:


        - Only Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers support VLANs. Run the [List
        regions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-regions) operation
        to view the capabilities of data center regions. If a VLAN is attached to
        your Linode and you attempt to migrate or clone it to a non-NGN data center,
        the migration or cloning will not initiate. If a Linode cannot be migrated
        or cloned because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to select a
        different data center or contact support.

        - Next Generation Network (NGN) data centers do not support IPv6 `/116` pools
        or IP Failover. If you have these features enabled on your Linode and attempt
        to migrate to an NGN data center, the migration will not initiate. If a Linode
        cannot be migrated because of an incompatibility, you will be prompted to
        select a different data center or contact support.

        - See the [VLANs Overview](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/networking/vlans/#technical-specifications)
        guide to view additional specifications and limitations.


        `public` details:


        - If the Linode is using Linode interfaces, the destination region needs to
        also support Linode interfaces.

        - After migrating to a different data center, Linode public interfaces retain
        the same number of IP addresses, but the IP addresses themselves change.

                    - If the target Linode is in a placement group, it will be removed
                    from it when migrating.

                    - The target placement group needs to be in the same `region`
                    you''re migrating to.

                    - The placement group needs to have capacity. Run the [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region)
                    operation and note either the `maximum_linodes_per_pg` (strict)

                    selected `placement_group_policy`. These represent the Linode
                    limit per placement group, for each `placement_group_policy` type.
                    You can then run the [Get a placement group](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-placement-group)

      description: 'Rescue Mode is a safe environment for performing many system recovery
        and disk management tasks. Rescue Mode is based on the Finnix recovery distribution,
        a self-contained and bootable Linux distribution. You can also use Rescue
        Mode for tasks other than disaster recovery, such as formatting disks to use
        different filesystems, copying data between disks, and downloading files from
        a disk via SSH and SFTP.


        Linodes with legacy configuration interfaces receive a public IP and boot
        into the recovery Linux distribution. Linodes with Linode interfaces still
        boot into recovery mode with the recovery Linux distribution, but they retain
        their original network interfaces and settings from before entering rescue
        mode.


        - Note that `sdh` is reserved and unavailable during rescue.

      description: "__Beta__ Automatically upgrades all legacy config interfaces of\
        \ a single configuration profile to Linode interfaces. A Linode interface\
        \ is directly associated with the Linode, rather than being tied to a configuration\
        \ profile.\n\nFirewalls are applied to the Linode interface, not directly\
        \ to the Linode itself.\n\n> \u2757\uFE0F This upgrade is irreversible\n>\n\
        > Once you upgrade a Linode to use Linode interfaces, you can't use legacy\
        \ config interfaces. This means you can no longer use the Linode with any\
        \ Linode products that require private IPs, such as NodeBalancer. You can\
        \ use `dry_run` to preview the upgrade.\n\nBefore upgrading interfaces, you\
        \ can check the new Linode interface configuration by performing a dry run,\
        \ where you set `dry_run` to `true` or omit it. A `dry_run` runs the upgrade\
        \ logic and returns a JSON representation of what the interface configuration\
        \ will be after the upgrade without committing any changes.\n\nWhen you run\
        \ this operation with `dry_run` set to `false`, the following occurs:\n  -\
        \ It creates matching interfaces on the Linode based on the interfaces present\
        \ on the `config_id`.\n  - All firewalls are removed from the Linode. Any\
        \ firewalls that were originally attached to the Linode are now applied to\
        \ the public and VPC interfaces. If the Linode has no firewalls attached,\
        \ then default firewalls are not used.\n  - If no legacy config interfaces\
        \ are defined (`legacy_config`) in the `config_id`, a public interface is\
        \ created using the public IPv4 assigned to the Linode. The same is the case\
        \ if the Linode has no config defined.\n  - For public interfaces, the Linode's\
        \ current MAC address and SLAAC address are conserved. The MAC address won't\
        \ change.\n  - It deletes all legacy config interfaces from all configs.\n\
        \  - It returns the list of interfaces for the Linode.\n\nRequirements:\n\
        \  - The `config_id` for the legacy config interfaces can't use a public interface\
        \ private IPv4 address.\n  - The Linode needs a MAC address in the database\
        \ if it's IPv6 enabled. If it doesn't, an error message tells you what to\
        \ do.\n  - The Linode must be in a region that supports Linode interfaces.\
        \ Run [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region).\n\
        \  - Your account must allow creation of Linodes with Linode interfaces, run\
        \ [Get account settings](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-account-settings).\n\
        \  - If the Linode has a user with a non-standard username, it can't be upgraded.\n\
