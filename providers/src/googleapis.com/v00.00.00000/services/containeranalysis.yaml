  title: Container Analysis API
  description: >-
    This API is a prerequisite for leveraging Artifact Analysis scanning
    capabilities in both Artifact Registry and with Advanced Vulnerability
    Insights (runtime scanning) in GKE. In addition, the Container Analysis API
    is an implementation of the Grafeas API, which enables storing, querying,
    and retrieval of critical metadata about all of your software artifacts.

            role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional
            role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset.
            The policy in the response might use the policy version that you
            specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if

        Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with
        respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy).
        Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map
        from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required
        parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification
        implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything
        more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or
        authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly
        selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a
        trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in
        any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not
        recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers
        to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The
        `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is
        included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore
        any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to
        explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message
        that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto
        message that holds this signature).

            - The vulnerable component is not present in the product.
            - >-
              The vulnerable code is not present. Typically this case occurs
              when source code is configured or built in a way that excludes the
              vulnerable code.
            - >-
              The vulnerable code can not be executed. Typically this case
              occurs when the product includes the vulnerable code but does not
              call or use the vulnerable code.
            - >-
              The vulnerable code cannot be controlled by an attacker to exploit
              the vulnerability.
            - >-
              The product includes built-in protections or features that prevent
              exploitation of the vulnerability. These built-in protections
              cannot be subverted by the attacker and cannot be configured or
              disabled by the user. These mitigations completely prevent
              exploitation based on known attack vectors.

        mechanism for the attached occurrences (Attestations). This grouping
        mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs gate the
        ability for a principle to attach an occurrence to a given note. It also

        occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same project.

            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
