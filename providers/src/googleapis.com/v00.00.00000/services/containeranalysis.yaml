  title: Container Analysis API
  description: >-
    This API is a prerequisite for leveraging Artifact Analysis scanning
    capabilities in both Artifact Registry and with Advanced Vulnerability
    Insights (runtime scanning) in GKE. In addition, the Container Analysis API
    is an implementation of the Grafeas API, which enables storing, querying,
    and retrieval of critical metadata about all of your software artifacts.

            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

      description: >-
        Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with
        respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy).
        Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map
        from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required
        parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification
        implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything
        more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or
        authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly
        selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a
        trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in
        any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not
        recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers
        to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The
        `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is
        included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore
        any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to
        explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message
        that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto
        message that holds this signature).

        provides a single point of lookup to find all attached attestation
        occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same project.

            Optional. The maximum policy version that will be used to format the
            policy. Valid values are 0, 1, and 3. Requests specifying an invalid
            value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional
            role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional
            role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset.
            The policy in the response might use the policy version that you
            specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if
            you specify version 3, but the policy has no conditional role
            bindings, the response uses version 1. To learn which resources
            support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
