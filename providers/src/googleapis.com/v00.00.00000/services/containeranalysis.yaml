            - The vulnerable code can not be executed. Typically this case occurs when the product includes the vulnerable code but does not call or use the vulnerable code.
            - The vulnerable code cannot be controlled by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
            - The product includes built-in protections or features that prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. These built-in protections cannot be subverted by the attacker and cannot be configured or disabled by the user. These mitigations completely prevent exploitation based on known attack vectors.

In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint.

Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes).

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.
