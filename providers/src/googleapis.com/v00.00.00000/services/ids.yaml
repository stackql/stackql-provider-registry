  title: Cloud IDS API
  description: >-
    Cloud IDS (Cloud Intrusion Detection System) detects malware, spyware,
    command-and-control attacks, and other network-based threats. Its security
    efficacy is industry leading, built with Palo Alto Networks technologies.
    When you use this product, your organization name and consumption levels
    will be shared with Palo Alto Networks.

        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
