              are reported to call attention to deeper problems that could
              possibly exist.
            - >-
              Warning-level threats that have very little impact on an
              organization's infrastructure. They usually require local or
              physical system access and may often result in victim privacy
              issues and information leakage.
            - >-
              Minor threats in which impact is minimized, that do not compromise
              the target or exploits that require an attacker to reside on the

              do not result in elevated privileges, or do not have a large
              victim pool.
            - >-
              Serious threats, such as those that affect default installations
              of widely deployed software, result in root compromise of servers,
              and the exploit code is widely available to attackers. The
              attacker usually does not need any special authentication
              credentials or knowledge about the individual victims and the
              target does not need to be manipulated into performing any special
              functions.

    GoogleIamV1Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        bindings:
          description: >-
            Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when
            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the
            first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an
            initial request and the request times out. If you make the request
            again with the same request ID, the server can check if original
            operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will
            ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
            creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID

        Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration
        determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if
        any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
        AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a

        service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and
        the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy

            The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the
            first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an
            initial request and the request times out. If you make the request
            again with the same request ID, the server can check if original
            operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will
            ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
            creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID
            with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
            (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

        An endpoint group association represents a link between a network and an
        endpoint group in the organization. Creating an association creates the
        networking infrastructure linking the network to the endpoint group, but
        does not enable mirroring by itself. To enable mirroring, the user must
        also create a network firewall policy containing mirroring rules and
        associate it with the network.
