      description: >-
        PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources
        (e.g. OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and
        delete them across projects and locations, at scale. Policy orchestrator
        functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes a set
        of resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes
        to them. If for some reason this set of resources changes over time
        (e.g. new projects are added), the future loop iterations will address
        that. Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For
        more details, see the description of the `action`, and
        `orchestrated_resource` fields. Note that policy orchestrator do not
        "manage" the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and
        only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud
        Logging). If orchestrator gets deleted, it does not affect the resources
        it created in the past. Those will remain where they were. Same applies
        if projects are removed from the orchestrator's scope.

        OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to apply a set of

        removing software packages, or executing a script. For more information

        A resource that allows executing scripts on the VM. The `ExecResource`
        has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages accept a script
        as an argument to execute. When the `ExecResource` is applied by the
        agent, it first executes the script in the `validate` stage. The
        `validate` stage can signal that the `ExecResource` is already in the
        desired state by returning an exit code of `100`. If the `ExecResource`
        is not in the desired state, it should return an exit code of `101`. Any
        other exit code returned by this stage is considered an error. If the
        `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code from
        the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from the
        `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired state,
        the `enforce` stage will not be run. Similar to `validate` stage, the
        `enforce` stage should return an exit code of `100` to indicate that the
        resource in now in its desired state. Any other exit code is considered
        an error. NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs
        `1`) to have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in
        desired state` and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always
        return an exit code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the
        script. So, for reasons of consistency and being explicit, exit codes
        `100` and `101` were chosen.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
