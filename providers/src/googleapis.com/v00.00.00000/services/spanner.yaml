    Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",

            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to

          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        version:
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

        A partition event record describes key range changes for a change stream
        partition. The changes to a row defined by its primary key can be
        captured in one change stream partition for a specific time range, and
        then be captured in a different change stream partition for a different
        time range. This movement of key ranges across change stream partitions
        is a reflection of activities, such as Spanner's dynamic splitting and
        load balancing, etc. Processing this event is needed if users want to
        guarantee processing of the changes for any key in timestamp order. If
        time ordered processing of changes for a primary key is not needed, this
        event can be ignored. To guarantee time ordered processing for each
        primary key, if the event describes move-ins, the reader of this
        partition needs to wait until the readers of the source partitions have
        processed all records with timestamps <= this
        PartitionEventRecord.commit_timestamp, before advancing beyond this
        PartitionEventRecord. If the event describes move-outs, the reader can
        notify the readers of the destination partitions that they can continue
        processing.

              Acquire shared locks. By default when you perform a read as part
              of a read-write transaction, Spanner acquires shared read locks,
              which allows other reads to still access the data until your
              transaction is ready to commit. When your transaction is
              committing and writes are being applied, the transaction attempts
              to upgrade to an exclusive lock for any data you are writing. For
              more information about locks, see [Lock
              modes](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/lock-statistics#explain-lock-modes).
            - >-
              Acquire exclusive locks. Requesting exclusive locks is beneficial
              if you observe high write contention, which means you notice that
              multiple transactions are concurrently trying to read and write to
              the same data, resulting in a large number of aborts. This problem
              occurs when two transactions initially acquire shared locks and
              then both try to upgrade to exclusive locks at the same time. In
              this situation both transactions are waiting for the other to give
              up their lock, resulting in a deadlocked situation. Spanner is
              able to detect this occurring and force one of the transactions to
              abort. However, this is a slow and expensive operation and results
              in lower performance. In this case it makes sense to acquire
              exclusive locks at the start of the transaction because then when
              multiple transactions try to act on the same data, they
              automatically get serialized. Each transaction waits its turn to
              acquire the lock and avoids getting into deadlock situations.
              Because the exclusive lock hint is just a hint, it shouldn't be
              considered equivalent to a mutex. In other words, you shouldn't
              use Spanner exclusive locks as a mutual exclusion mechanism for
              the execution of code outside of Spanner. **Note:** Request
              exclusive locks judiciously because they block others from reading
              that data for the entire transaction, rather than just when the
              writes are being performed. Unless you observe high write
              contention, you should use the default of shared read locks so you
              don't prematurely block other clients from reading the data that
              you're writing to.

            updates made within this transaction aren't recorded in the change
            stream. * If you don't set the DDL option `allow_txn_exclusion` or
            if it's set to `false`, then the updates made within this
            transaction are recorded in the change stream. When
            `exclude_txn_from_change_streams` is set to `false` or not set,
            modifications from this transaction are recorded in all change
            streams that are tracking columns modified by these transactions.
            The `exclude_txn_from_change_streams` option can only be specified
            for read-write or partitioned DML transactions, otherwise the API
            returns an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.

              isolation level is used.
            - >-
              All transactions appear as if they executed in a serial order,
              even if some of the reads, writes, and other operations of
              distinct transactions actually occurred in parallel. Spanner
              assigns commit timestamps that reflect the order of committed
              transactions to implement this property. Spanner offers a stronger
              guarantee than serializability called external consistency. For
              more information, see [TrueTime and external
              consistency](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency#serializability).
            - >-
              All reads performed during the transaction observe a consistent
              snapshot of the database, and the transaction is only successfully
              committed in the absence of conflicts between its updates and any
              concurrent updates that have occurred since that snapshot.
              Consequently, in contrast to `SERIALIZABLE` transactions, only
              write-write conflicts are detected in snapshot transactions. This
              isolation level does not support read-only and partitioned DML
              transactions. When `REPEATABLE_READ` is specified on a read-write
              transaction, the locking semantics default to `OPTIMISTIC`.

    KeyRange:
      description: >-
        KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index. A range has a
        start key and an end key. These keys can be open or closed, indicating
        if the range includes rows with that key. Keys are represented by lists,
        where the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the
        table or index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described
        here. For example, consider the following table definition: CREATE TABLE
        UserEvents ( UserName STRING(MAX), EventDate STRING(10) ) PRIMARY
        KEY(UserName, EventDate); The following keys name rows in this table:
        "Bob", "2014-09-23" Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY KEY` clause
        names two columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the first is
        the `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`. Key ranges with
        multiple components are interpreted lexicographically by component using
        the table or index key's declared sort order. For example, the following
        range returns all events for user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year
        2015: "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"] "end_closed": ["Bob",
        "2015-12-31"] Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This
        affects the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the
        provided key components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly
        match the provided components are included; if the key is open, then
        rows that exactly match are not included. For example, the following
        range includes all events for `"Bob"` that occurred during and after the
        year 2000: "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"] "end_closed": ["Bob"]
        The next example retrieves all events for `"Bob"`: "start_closed":
        ["Bob"] "end_closed": ["Bob"] To retrieve events before the year 2000:
        "start_closed": ["Bob"] "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"] The following
        range includes all rows in the table: "start_closed": [] "end_closed":
        [] This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with any
        character from A to C: "start_closed": ["A"] "end_open": ["D"] This
        range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B: "start_closed":
        ["B"] "end_open": ["C"] Key ranges honor column sort order. For example,
        suppose a table is defined as follows: CREATE TABLE
        DescendingSortedTable { Key INT64, ... ) PRIMARY KEY(Key DESC); The
        following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and 100
        inclusive: "start_closed": ["100"] "end_closed": ["1"] Note that 100 is
        passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end, because `Key` is a
        descending column in the schema.

            databases within the instance. By default, a backup schedule is
            created automatically when a new database is created in a new
            instance. Note that the `AUTOMATIC` value isn't permitted for free
            instances, as backups and backup schedules aren't supported for free
            instances. In the `GetInstance` or `ListInstances` response, if the
            value of `default_backup_schedule_type` isn't set, or set to `NONE`,
            Spanner doesn't create a default backup schedule for new databases
            in the instance.

            Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing
            cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational
            needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter
            collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource
            metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
            management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.). *
            Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
            to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values
            must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the
            regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can
            be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for
            more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use
            labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may
            be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an internal
            label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon specific
            characters being disallowed. For example, representing labels as the
            string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if we were to
            allow "_" in a future release.

            Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing
            cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational
            needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter
            collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource
            metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
            management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.). *
            Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
            to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values
            must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the
            regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can
            be associated with a given resource. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for
            more information on and examples of labels. If you plan to use
            labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may
            be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use an
            internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
            specific characters being disallowed. For example, representing
            labels as the string: name + "_" + value would prove problematic if
            we were to allow "_" in a future release.

        values:
          description: >-
            A streamed result set consists of a stream of values, which might be
            split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate large
            rows and/or large values. Every N complete values defines a row,
            where N is equal to the number of entries in
            metadata.row_type.fields. Most values are encoded based on type as
            described here. It's possible that the last value in values is
            "chunked", meaning that the rest of the value is sent in subsequent
            `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the chunked_value field.
            Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a complete value as
            follows: * `bool/number/null`: can't be chunked * `string`:
            concatenate the strings * `list`: concatenate the lists. If the last
            element in a list is a `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with
            the first element in the next list by applying these rules
            recursively. * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value)
            pairs. If a field name is duplicated, then apply these rules
            recursively to merge the field values. Some examples of merging:
            Strings are concatenated. "foo", "bar" => "foobar" Lists of
            non-strings are concatenated. [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4] Lists are
            concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged because
            they are strings. ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"] Lists
            are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged because
            they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements of the
            inner lists are merged because they are strings. ["a", ["b", "c"]],
            [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"] Non-overlapping object
            fields are combined. {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
            Overlapping object fields are merged. {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} =>
            {"a": "12"} Examples of merging objects containing lists of strings.
            {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]} For a more complete
            example, suppose a streaming SQL query is yielding a result set
            whose rows contain a single string field. The following
            `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded: { "metadata": { ... }
            "values": ["Hello", "W"] "chunked_value": true "resume_token":
            "Af65..." } { "values": ["orl"] "chunked_value": true } { "values":
            ["d"] "resume_token": "Zx1B..." } This sequence of
            `PartialResultSet`s encodes two rows, one containing the field value
            `"Hello"`, and a second containing the field value `"World" = "W" +
            "orl" + "d"`. Not all `PartialResultSet`s contain a `resume_token`.
            Execution can only be resumed from a previously yielded
            `resume_token`. For the above sequence of `PartialResultSet`s,
            resuming the query with `"resume_token": "Af65..."` yields results
            from the `PartialResultSet` with value "orl".

        for eg. Bigtable keyspaces are lexicographically ordered mappings of
        keys to values. Keys often have a shared prefix structure where users
        use the keys to organize data. Eg ///employee In this case Keysight will

            An option to control the selection of optimizer version. This
            parameter allows individual queries to pick different query
            optimizer versions. Specifying `latest` as a value instructs Cloud
            Spanner to use the latest supported query optimizer version. If not
            specified, Cloud Spanner uses the optimizer version set at the
            database level options. Any other positive integer (from the list of
            supported optimizer versions) overrides the default optimizer
            version for query execution. The list of supported optimizer
            versions can be queried from
            `SPANNER_SYS.SUPPORTED_OPTIMIZER_VERSIONS`. Executing a SQL
            statement with an invalid optimizer version fails with an

            This parameter allows individual queries to use a different query
            optimizer statistics package. Specifying `latest` as a value
            instructs Cloud Spanner to use the latest generated statistics
            package. If not specified, Cloud Spanner uses the statistics package
            set at the database level options, or the latest package if the
            database option isn't set. The statistics package requested by the
            query has to be exempt from garbage collection. This can be achieved
            with the following DDL statement: ```sql ALTER STATISTICS SET
            OPTIONS (allow_gc=false) ``` The list of available statistics
            packages can be queried from
            `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SPANNER_STATISTICS`. Executing a SQL statement
            with an invalid optimizer statistics package or with a statistics
            package that allows garbage collection fails with an
            `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.

        the given project. An instance configuration operation has a name of the
        form `projects//instanceConfigs//operations/`. The long-running
        operation metadata field type `metadata.type_url` describes the type of
        the metadata. Operations returned include those that have
        completed/failed/canceled within the last 7 days, and pending
        operations. Operations returned are ordered by
        `operation.metadata.value.start_time` in descending order starting from
        the most recently started operation.

        Rolls back a transaction, releasing any locks it holds. It's a good idea
        to call this for any transaction that includes one or more Read or
        ExecuteSql requests and ultimately decides not to commit. `Rollback`
        returns `OK` if it successfully aborts the transaction, the transaction
        was already aborted, or the transaction isn't found. `Rollback` never
        returns `ABORTED`.

        Creates a new session. A session can be used to perform transactions
        that read and/or modify data in a Cloud Spanner database. Sessions are
        meant to be reused for many consecutive transactions. Sessions can only
        execute one transaction at a time. To execute multiple concurrent
        read-write/write-only transactions, create multiple sessions. Note that
        standalone reads and queries use a transaction internally, and count
        toward the one transaction limit. Active sessions use additional server
        resources, so it's a good idea to delete idle and unneeded sessions.
        Aside from explicit deletes, Cloud Spanner can delete sessions when no
        operations are sent for more than an hour. If a session is deleted,
        requests to it return `NOT_FOUND`. Idle sessions can be kept alive by
        sending a trivial SQL query periodically, for example, `"SELECT 1"`.

        return a result set larger than 10 MiB; if the read matches more data
        than that, the read fails with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error. Reads
        inside read-write transactions might return `ABORTED`. If this occurs,
        the application should restart the transaction from the beginning. See
        Transaction for more details. Larger result sets can be yielded in
        streaming fashion by calling StreamingRead instead.

      description: >-
        Batches the supplied mutation groups in a collection of efficient
        transactions. All mutations in a group are committed atomically.
        However, mutations across groups can be committed non-atomically in an
        unspecified order and thus, they must be independent of each other.
        Partial failure is possible, that is, some groups might have been
        committed successfully, while some might have failed. The results of
        individual batches are streamed into the response as the batches are
        applied. `BatchWrite` requests are not replay protected, meaning that
        each mutation group can be applied more than once. Replays of
        non-idempotent mutations can have undesirable effects. For example,
        replays of an insert mutation can produce an already exists error or if
        you use generated or commit timestamp-based keys, it can result in
        additional rows being added to the mutation's table. We recommend
        structuring your mutation groups to be idempotent to avoid this issue.

        Commits a transaction. The request includes the mutations to be applied

        can occur at any time; commonly, the cause is conflicts with concurrent
        transactions. However, it can also happen for a variety of other
        reasons. If `Commit` returns `ABORTED`, the caller should retry the
        transaction from the beginning, reusing the same session. On very rare
        occasions, `Commit` might return `UNKNOWN`. This can happen, for
        example, if the client job experiences a 1+ hour networking failure. At
        that point, Cloud Spanner has lost track of the transaction outcome and
        we recommend that you perform another read from the database to see the

        Returns permissions that the caller has on the specified database or
        backup resource. Attempting this RPC on a non-existent Cloud Spanner
        database will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
        `spanner.databases.list` permission on the containing Cloud Spanner
        instance. Otherwise returns an empty set of permissions. Calling this
        method on a backup that does not exist will result in a NOT_FOUND error
        if the user has `spanner.backups.list` permission on the containing
        instance. Calling this method on a backup schedule that does not exist
        will result in a NOT_FOUND error if the user has
        `spanner.backupSchedules.list` permission on the containing database.

        Starts copying a Cloud Spanner Backup. The returned backup long-running
        operation will have a name of the format
        `projects//instances//backups//operations/` and can be used to track
        copying of the backup. The operation is associated with the destination
        backup. The metadata field type is CopyBackupMetadata. The response
        field type is Backup, if successful. Cancelling the returned operation
        will stop the copying and delete the destination backup. Concurrent
        CopyBackup requests can run on the same source backup.

        Creates an instance and begins preparing it to begin serving. The
        returned long-running operation can be used to track the progress of
        preparing the new instance. The instance name is assigned by the caller.
        If the named instance already exists, `CreateInstance` returns
        `ALREADY_EXISTS`. Immediately upon completion of this request: * The
        instance is readable via the API, with all requested attributes but no
        allocated resources. Its state is `CREATING`. Until completion of the
        returned operation: * Cancelling the operation renders the instance
        immediately unreadable via the API. * The instance can be deleted. * All
        other attempts to modify the instance are rejected. Upon completion of
        the returned operation: * Billing for all successfully-allocated
        resources begins (some types may have lower than the requested levels).
        * Databases can be created in the instance. * The instance's allocated
        resource levels are readable via the API. * The instance's state becomes
        `READY`. The returned long-running operation will have a name of the
        format `/operations/` and can be used to track creation of the instance.
        The metadata field type is CreateInstanceMetadata. The response field
        type is Instance, if successful.

        Moves an instance to the target instance configuration. You can use the
        returned long-running operation to track the progress of moving the
        instance. `MoveInstance` returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the instance
        meets any of the following criteria: * Is undergoing a move to a
        different instance configuration * Has backups * Has an ongoing update *
        Contains any CMEK-enabled databases * Is a free trial instance While the
        operation is pending: * All other attempts to modify the instance,
        including changes to its compute capacity, are rejected. * The following
        database and backup admin operations are rejected: *
        `DatabaseAdmin.CreateDatabase` * `DatabaseAdmin.UpdateDatabaseDdl`
        (disabled if default_leader is specified in the request.) *
        `DatabaseAdmin.RestoreDatabase` * `DatabaseAdmin.CreateBackup` *
        `DatabaseAdmin.CopyBackup` * Both the source and target instance
        configurations are subject to hourly compute and storage charges. * The
        instance might experience higher read-write latencies and a higher
        transaction abort rate. However, moving an instance doesn't cause any
        downtime. The returned long-running operation has a name of the format
        `/operations/` and can be used to track the move instance operation. The
        metadata field type is MoveInstanceMetadata. The response field type is
        Instance, if successful. Cancelling the operation sets its metadata's
        cancel_time. Cancellation is not immediate because it involves moving
        any data previously moved to the target instance configuration back to
        the original instance configuration. You can use this operation to track
        the progress of the cancellation. Upon successful completion of the
        cancellation, the operation terminates with `CANCELLED` status. If not
        cancelled, upon completion of the returned operation: * The instance
        successfully moves to the target instance configuration. * You are
        billed for compute and storage in target instance configuration.
        Authorization requires the `spanner.instances.update` permission on the
        resource instance. For more details, see [Move an
        instance](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/move-instance).
