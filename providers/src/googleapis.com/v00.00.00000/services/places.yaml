        `locationBias` or `locationRestriction` request option to bias the
        search results. However, while the `locationBias` and
        `locationRestriction` options let you specify a region to bias the
        search results, this option lets you bias the results along a trip
        route. Results are not guaranteed to be along the route provided, but
        rather are ranked within the search area defined by the polyline and,
        optionally, by the `locationBias` or `locationRestriction` based on
        minimal detour times from origin to destination. The results might be
        along an alternate route, especially if the provided polyline does not
        define an optimal route from origin to destination.

            disambiguating features (such as a city or region).
            `structured_format` is recommended for developers who wish to show
            two separate, but related, UI elements. Developers who wish to show
            a single UI element may want to use `text` instead. They are two
            different ways to represent a Place prediction. Users should not try
            to parse `structured_format` into `text` or vice versa.

        90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180
        to 180 degrees inclusive. Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`,
        the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` >
        `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses
        the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and
        `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. -
        If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees,
        the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the
        latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and
        the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions

            - >-
              Computes routes without taking live traffic conditions into
              consideration. Suitable when traffic conditions don't matter or
              are not applicable. Using this value produces the lowest latency.
              Note: For `TravelMode` `DRIVE` and `TWO_WHEELER`, the route and
              duration chosen are based on road network and average
              time-independent traffic conditions, not current road conditions.
              Consequently, routes may include roads that are temporarily
              closed. Results for a given request may vary over time due to
              changes in the road network, updated average traffic conditions,
              and the distributed nature of the service. Results may also vary
              between nearly-equivalent routes at any time or frequency.
            - >-
              Calculates routes taking live traffic conditions into

              Calculates the routes taking live traffic conditions into

        sessionToken:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session for
            billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64 string with
            at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned. The session begins when the user starts typing a
            query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address
            Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a
            session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a
            session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must
            generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token`
            parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session
            is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is
            billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use
            session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh
            token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. *
            Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
            Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to
            the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session
            token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one
            session will result in each request being billed individually.
