            The predicted text. This text does not represent a Place, but rather
            a text query that could be used in a search endpoint (for example,
            Text Search). `text` is recommended for developers who wish to show
            a single UI element. Developers who wish to show two separate, but
            related, UI elements may want to use `structured_format` instead.
            They are two different ways to represent a query prediction. Users
            should not try to parse `structured_format` into `text` or vice
            versa. May be in mixed languages if the request `input` and
            `language_code` are in different languages or if part of the query
            does not have a translation from the local language to
            `language_code`.

        A latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two diagonally opposite
        `low` and `high` points. A viewport is considered a closed region, i.e.
        it includes its boundary. The latitude bounds must range between -90 to
        90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180
        to 180 degrees inclusive. Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`,
        the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` >
        `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses
        the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and
        `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. -
        If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees,
        the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the
        latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and
        the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions
        above). An empty viewport will result in an error. For example, this
        viewport fully encloses New York City: { "low": { "latitude": 40.477398,

            at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned. The session begins when the user starts typing a
            query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address
            Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a
            session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a
            session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must
            generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token`
            parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session
            is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is
            billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use
            session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh
            token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. *
            Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
            Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to
            the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session
            token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one
            session will result in each request being billed individually.
