The latitude bounds must range between -90 to 90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180 to 180 degrees inclusive. Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`, the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` > `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. - If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty viewport will result in an error.
