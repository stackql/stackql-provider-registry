              consideration. Suitable when traffic conditions don't matter or
              are not applicable. Using this value produces the lowest latency.
              Note: For `TravelMode` `DRIVE` and `TWO_WHEELER`, the route and
              duration chosen are based on road network and average
              time-independent traffic conditions, not current road conditions.
              Consequently, routes may include roads that are temporarily
              closed. Results for a given request may vary over time due to
              changes in the road network, updated average traffic conditions,
              and the distributed nature of the service. Results may also vary
              between nearly-equivalent routes at any time or frequency.

            `location_bias` or `location_restriction` should be set. If neither
            are set, the results will be biased by IP address, meaning the IP
            address will be mapped to an imprecise location and used as a

          description: >-
            Optional. The language in which to return results. Defaults to
            en-US. The results may be in mixed languages if the language used in
            `input` is different from `language_code` or if the returned Place
            does not have a translation from the local language to

            influence what results are returned. This does not restrict results
            to the specified region. To restrict results to a region, use
            `region_code_restriction`.
          type: string
        sessionToken:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session for
            billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64 string with
            at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned. The session begins when the user starts typing a
            query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address
            Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a
            session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a
            session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must
            generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token`
            parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session
            is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is
            billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use
            session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh
            token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. *
            Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
            Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to
            the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session
            token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one
            session will result in each request being billed individually.

        `locationRestriction` options let you specify a region to bias the

        rather are ranked within the search area defined by the polyline and,
        optionally, by the `locationBias` or `locationRestriction` based on
