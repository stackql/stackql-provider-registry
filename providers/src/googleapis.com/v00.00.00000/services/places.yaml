    GoogleTypePostalAddress:
      description: >-
        Represents a postal address, such as for postal delivery or payments
        addresses. With a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to
        a premise, P.O. box, or similar. A postal address is not intended to
        model geographical locations like roads, towns, or mountains. In typical
        usage, an address would be created by user input or from importing
        existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input
        or editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as
        https://github.com/google/libaddressinput. - Users should not be
        presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside
        countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this
        schema, see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478.
      properties:
        languageCode:
          description: >-
            Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if
            known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is
            expected to match one of the languages used in the address'
            country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect
            formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the
            correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
            other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known,
            it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect
            default). Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
          type: string
        recipients:
          description: >-
            Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under
            certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example,
            it might contain "care of" information.

        locality:
          description: >-
            Optional. Generally refers to the city or town portion of the
            address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of
            the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into
            this structure well, leave `locality` empty and use `address_lines`.
          type: string
        addressLines:
          type: array
          description: >-
            Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an
            address. Because values in `address_lines` do not have type
            information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single
            field (for example, "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line
            order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope
            order" for the country or region of the address. In places where
            this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to
            make it explicit (for example, "ja" for large-to-small ordering and
            "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). In this way, the most
            specific line of an address can be selected based on the language.
            The minimum permitted structural representation of an address
            consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in
            the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address
            very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning
            could be made about any of the address components until it was at
            least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a
            `region_code` and `address_lines` and then geocoding is the
            recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as
            opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities
            or administrative areas).

        postalCode:

            Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or
            require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they
            may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address
            (for example, state or zip code validation in the United States).

            like "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (for example, "CEDEX
            7"), or just a number alone, representing the "sector code"

          type: string
        administrativeArea:
          description: >-
            Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for
            postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a
            state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. For Spain, this is
            the province and not the autonomous community (for example,
            "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an
            administrative area in postal addresses. For example, in
            Switzerland, this should be left unpopulated.

          enumDescriptions:
            - No routing preference specified. Default to `TRAFFIC_UNAWARE`.
            - >-
              Computes routes without taking live traffic conditions into
              consideration. Suitable when traffic conditions don't matter or
              are not applicable. Using this value produces the lowest latency.
              Note: For `TravelMode` `DRIVE` and `TWO_WHEELER`, the route and
              duration chosen are based on road network and average
              time-independent traffic conditions, not current road conditions.
              Consequently, routes may include roads that are temporarily
              closed. Results for a given request may vary over time due to
              changes in the road network, updated average traffic conditions,
              and the distributed nature of the service. Results may also vary
              between nearly-equivalent routes at any time or frequency.
            - >-
              Calculates routes taking live traffic conditions into
              consideration. In contrast to `TRAFFIC_AWARE_OPTIMAL`, some
              optimizations are applied to significantly reduce latency.

            `location_bias` or `location_restriction` should be set. If neither
            are set, the results will be biased by IP address, meaning the IP

        languageCode:
          description: >-
            Optional. The language in which to return results. Defaults to

            (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types),
            or only `(regions)`, or only `(cities)`. A Place is only returned if
            its primary type is included in this list. Up to 5 values can be
            specified. If no types are specified, all Place types are returned.

            `location_bias` or `location_restriction` should be set. If neither
            are set, the results will be biased by IP address, meaning the IP
            address will be mapped to an imprecise location and used as a

        includeQueryPredictions:

          description: >-
            Optional. If true, the response will include both Place and query
            predictions. Otherwise the response will only return Place
            predictions.
        sessionToken:
          description: >-
            Optional. A string which identifies an Autocomplete session for
            billing purposes. Must be a URL and filename safe base64 string with
            at most 36 ASCII characters in length. Otherwise an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned. The session begins when the user starts typing a
            query, and concludes when they select a place and a call to Place
            Details or Address Validation is made. Each session can have
            multiple queries, followed by one Place Details or Address
            Validation request. The credentials used for each request within a
            session must belong to the same Google Cloud Console project. Once a
            session has concluded, the token is no longer valid; your app must
            generate a fresh token for each session. If the `session_token`
            parameter is omitted, or if you reuse a session token, the session
            is charged as if no session token was provided (each request is
            billed separately). We recommend the following guidelines: * Use
            session tokens for all Place Autocomplete calls. * Generate a fresh
            token for each session. Using a version 4 UUID is recommended. *
            Ensure that the credentials used for all Place Autocomplete, Place
            Details, and Address Validation requests within a session belong to
            the same Cloud Console project. * Be sure to pass a unique session
            token for each new session. Using the same token for more than one
            session will result in each request being billed individually.
          type: string
        regionCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. The region code, specified as a CLDR two-character region
            code. This affects address formatting, result ranking, and may
            influence what results are returned. This does not restrict results
            to the specified region. To restrict results to a region, use
            `region_code_restriction`.

        `locationRestriction` options let you specify a region to bias the

        route. Results are not guaranteed to be along the route provided, but

        optionally, by the `locationBias` or `locationRestriction` based on
        minimal detour times from origin to destination. The results might be

        A latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two diagonally opposite

        90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180
        to 180 degrees inclusive. Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`,
        the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` >
        `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses
        the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and
        `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. -
        If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees,
        the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the
