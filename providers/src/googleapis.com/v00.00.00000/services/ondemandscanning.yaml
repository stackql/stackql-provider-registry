      description: 'Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy). Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto message that holds this signature).'

            - The vulnerable code can not be executed. Typically this case occurs when the product includes the vulnerable code but does not call or use the vulnerable code.
            - The vulnerable code cannot be controlled by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
            - The product includes built-in protections or features that prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. These built-in protections cannot be subverted by the attacker and cannot be configured or disabled by the user. These mitigations completely prevent exploitation based on known attack vectors.

      description: 'Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is no guarantee that the operation is done.'

      description: 'Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn''t support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.'
