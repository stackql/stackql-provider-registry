      description: >-
        Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with
        respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy).
        Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map
        from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required
        parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification
        implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything
        more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or
        authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly
        selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a
        trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in
        any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not
        recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers
        to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The
        `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is
        included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore
        any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to
        explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message
        that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto
        message that holds this signature).

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.
