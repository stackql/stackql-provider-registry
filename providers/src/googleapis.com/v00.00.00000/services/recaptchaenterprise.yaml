              - Indicates that the transaction had a chargeback issued related to the cardholder having provided their card details but allegedly not being satisfied with the purchase (for example, misrepresentation, attempted cancellation).
              - Indicates that the completed payment transaction was refunded by the seller.
              - Indicates that the completed payment transaction was determined to be fraudulent by the seller, and was cancelled and refunded as a result.
              - Indicates that the payment transaction was accepted, and the user was charged.
              - Indicates that the payment transaction was declined, for example due to invalid card details.
              - Indicates the transaction associated with the assessment is suspected of being fraudulent based on the payment method, billing details, shipping address or other transaction information.
              - Indicates that the user was served a 2FA challenge. An old assessment with `ENUM_VALUES.INITIATED_TWO_FACTOR` reason that has not been overwritten with `PASSED_TWO_FACTOR` is treated as an abandoned 2FA flow. This is equivalent to `FAILED_TWO_FACTOR`.
              - Indicates that the user passed a 2FA challenge.
              - Indicates that the user failed a 2FA challenge.
              - Indicates the user provided the correct password.
              - Indicates the user provided an incorrect password.
              - Indicates that the user sent unwanted and abusive messages to other users of the platform, such as spam, scams, phishing, or social engineering.
