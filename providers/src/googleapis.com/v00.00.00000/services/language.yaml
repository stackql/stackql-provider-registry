            The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That
            is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color =
            alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This
            means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a
            value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This
            uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it
            is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value
            being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid
            color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of
            1.0).

        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...
        public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha =
        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return
        new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(),
        protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color
        toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed();
        float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float)
        color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder
        = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green /
        denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha();
        if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder()
        .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return
        resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static
        UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red];
        float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue];
        FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if
        (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return
        [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static
        Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if
        (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return
        nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red];
        [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) {
        [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease];
        return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor
        = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var
        greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue ||
