    SimpleSecretLabelProto:
      description: SimpleSecretProto (in authenticator.proto) and SimpleSecretHolderProto (below) share the notion of a "label", which identifies a particular secret without (hopefully) revealing the secret. Note that a SimpleSecretLabel only disambiguates between secrets used to get access to some particular object. Two different secrets that apply to two different objects could have the same label. For example, in the common sharing model, each object has no more than one "auth key". Therefore, the label for an auth key simply has type = AUTH_KEY with no additional information. In theory, we could add some sort of resource ID to SimpleSecretLabel to make it more explicit. However, in practice, this is never really needed. A SimpleSecret for one object is never used to authorize a request on some other object, so there is no ambiguity. Also, since SimpleSecrets must obviously be unguessable, there is no risk that a SimpleSecret intended for one object will accidentally grant access to another.

The corresponding secret is the SecretMaterial, as defined by InviteToken.SecretMaterial in acl.proto, encoded in 64-bit big-endian. If there is no SecretMaterial, the secret should be omitted; in this case the invite ID itself is the secret, which is less secure.

        type:
          enum:
            - TEXT
            - LINE_BREAK
            - LINK
            - USER_MENTION
            - ALL_USER_MENTION
            - HASHTAG
          enumDescriptions:
            - A TEXT segment represents plain-text subject to particular formatting constraints (as represented in the "formatting" field of the Segment).
            - A LINE_BREAK segment is simply a placeholder to represent a line break between other segments. The "text" variable may be set to a newline as a fallback, but clients that understand this segment type should simply insert a line break without needing to reference any fields.
            - A LINK segment represents a link to a web entity. The "text" field should be used for anchor text. Additional link data should be put in the link_data protobuf.
            - A USER_MENTION segment represents a reference to a (possibly non-Gaia, possibly off-network) user. The "text" field may be populated as a fallback, but information identifying the user should be contained in the user_mention_data protobuf. (The set of fields that are populated in user_mention_data may differ depending on the context in which the segment is viewed, but the interpretation of the fields is uniform. See comments over UserMentionData).
            - An ALL_USER_MENTION segment represents a reference to all users in the context, that is, the conversation, discussion, or other context containing the segment. For example, an ALL_USER_MENTION segment ("@all") can be useful to ping all participants in a conversation if the notification setting of the conversation is not set to ping on normal messages. An ALL_USER_MENTION should be treated as a USER_MENTION for all users who receives the segment.
            - A HASHTAG segment represents a structured reference to a topic. The "text" field should represent display text (e.g. "#Google"), and additional metadata should be put in the Segment's hashtag_data field.
          description: Type of Segment.
          type: string
        text:
          description: Text content of the Segment. As a general rule, this field should contain the actual text that should be rendered in the UI. Thus, for a hashtag, it should be "#Foo", and for a link, it should be the display text. Clients that do not understand a particular segment type may use this text, along with the Formatting info below, as a fallback for display. The field is not required -- if all relevant information is carried in other metadata fields and there is no need for a fallback, or it is not practical for a fallback to be provided for any other reason, the field may be left blank. A standard example would be a user reference being transmitted between server layers, where a gaia-ID representation may be sufficient and there is no need for a textual fallback. In such a case, it would be valid and useful - though not required - for servers to compute and populate a fallback on the serving path.

Clients that understand the Embed type within the Attachment may construct and/or decorate their link appropriately e.g. to make use of type-specific functionality or first-party integrations. The link_target and (if appropriate) display_url fields must still be set even when an Attachment is present, so that clients who do not know how to interpret the Attachment can fall back to those fields, and render the Segment as an ordinary web link. N.B. Even when an Attachment is present, the intention of a "LINK" Segment is for the Segment to be presented inline with the rest of the text of a post or comment, with a clickable link or other UI suitable for inlining (though the client may modify the UI based on Attachment data, e.g. to add appropriate hovers, icons, etc.). When an entity is intended to be rendered separately from the main body of the post/comment, a separate Attachment proto can be added outside the set of Segments. N.B. Within the Attachment, fields of EmbedClientItem have their own visibility annotations, which should be enforced separately from Segment visibility annotations.

(1): Item "fields" are common to items of all message types (e.g. mail, chat, task, etc.) and are identified by the ItemFieldSpec.FetchType enum when fetching Items. (2): Item "attributes" represent data associated with an Item that is stored on behalf of the client but to which the fusebox and storage layers are otherwise agnostic. (3): Item "parts" are application-defined protocol buffers that affect how the Item is indexed. Item parts are referenced as extensions to the ItemParts message. By default the application specifies the index terms associated with an Item part. For performance sensitive applications, the storage layer can be modified to understand and index data types natively.'

Later role update and target audience update started relying on this to communicate information to clients about what transition happened. So this is now required to be populated and should be in sync with affected_members for new messages.

    Color:
      id: Color
      description: 'Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor''s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn''t carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!(''alpha'' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join('',''); return [''rgba('', rgbParams, '','', alphaFrac, '')''].join(''''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = [''#'']; for (var i = 0; i < missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push(''0''); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''''); }; // ...'

          description: Indicates whether form values persist after the action. When false, the Apps Script is responsible for persisting values, by setting any form field values using the formInputs in the event. Disabling this behavior can be used if the add-on needs the ability to clear form fields, for example, as with persistent values, there is no means for clearing existing values. When disabling persistent values, it is strongly recommended that the add-on use LoadIndicator.SPINNER for all events, as this locks the UI to ensure no changes are made by the user while the action is being processed. When using LoadIndicator.NONE for any of the actions, persistent values are recommended, as it ensures that any changes made by the user after form / on change actions are sent to the server are not overwritten by the response. Persistent values disabled by default. While we recommend persistent values be used in the typical use case, we do not enable by default, as doing so would change the current behavior of existing add-ons in prod.

You must use the integer value in combination with ordered ranking to set the ranking of a given value relative to other enumerated values for the same property name. Here, a ranking order of DESCENDING for *priority* properties results in a ranking boost for items indexed with a value of *p0* compared to items indexed with a value of *p1*.

    EmbedClientItem:
      description: 'Represents an embedded object in an update. This is a wrapper class that can contain a single specific item proto in an extension field. Think of it as a base class like `Message` in Java. Each item proto must declare that it extends this proto: message ExampleObject { option (item_type) = EXAMPLE_OBJECT; extend EmbedClientItem { optional ExampleObject example_object = ; } } See go/es-embeds for details.'
      properties:
        deepLinkData:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/DeepLinkData'
          description: Deep-linking data to take the user to the right place in a mobile app. This is only used for preview and attribution. Links that are specific to a given embed type should live on that specific embed's proto by using Link. See http://goto.google.com/mariana-design.
        id:
          description: The ID of the embed. This corresponds to the schema.org ID, as represented in the ItemScope.id field.
          type: string
        transientData:
          description: Transient generic data that will not be saved on the server.
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/TransientData'
        renderId:
          type: string
          description: The ID used to identify the embed during rendering. This field will match ID, if set, otherwise it will be the ID of the parent activity. This field is only populated on the server for client use and is not persisted to storage.
        provenance:
          description: The provenance of the embed, populated when the embed originated from a web fetch. The provenance captures information about the web page the embed had originated, like the URL that was retrieved and the retrieved URL's canonical form. This is useful in the case where the URL shared by the URL redirects (e.g., in the case of a shortened URL).
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/Provenance'
        type:
          description: The first value in `type` determines which extension field will be set. When creating an EmbedClientItem, you only need to set the first (primary) type in this field. When the server receives the item, it will populate the full type list using the parent annotations in the ItemType enum.

            - This action begins the message expunge process. It will trigger a purge attempt for all messages that have this trigger.
            - When this trigger fires, the current retention policy will be loaded from the policy management system and stored into the preference cache (if necessary). This will also create new expunge triggers if necessary.
            - When this trigger fires, the message should be used to update the user's importance model. See http://go/io-tingle for more details.
            - Sends the trigger to the master Caribou server via the Stubby TriggerHandlerService interface (defined in caribou/coproc/proto/trigger_handler.proto). The trigger is handled at fire time in the account's primary replica, and only in non-primary replicas after a delay.
            - Similar to ACTION_INVOKE_CS, but instead of sending the trigger to the master Caribou server, sends it to a Stratus server that also implements the TriggerHandlerService. This Stratus server is specified via FLAGS_triggers_stratus_server_address. The trigger is handled at fire time in the account's primary replica, and only in non-primary replicas after a delay.
            - This action begins the message's PDH expunge. It will trigger a expunge (from pdh) attempt for all messages that have this trigger.
            - 'When this trigger fires, based on the latest retention policy: 1. messages that need to be deleted will be deleted through the CS trigger handler 2. ^deleted messages that need to be expunged will be expunged'
            - Similar to ACTION_INVOKE_CS, but instead of sending the trigger to the master Caribou server, sends it to a jobsetted server in the user's master jobset using the consistent-hash homing algorithm. The jobsetted_server_spec must be specified when using this TriggerAction.
            - Send the trigger to a Tasks server that implements the TriggerHandlerService. Dispatched via GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_tasks_server_address.
            - Send the trigger to a SmartMail Publisher server that implements the TriggerHandlerService. Dispatched via GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_publisher_server_address.
            - Send the trigger to an Observer server that implements the TriggerHandlerService. Dispatched via GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_observer_server_address.
            - Push a set of history records to PDH.
            - Send the trigger to the stubby dispatcher, which routes the RPC using the value of Trigger.dispatch_id as the RoutingInfo.extension_tag field. Dispatched via the GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_stubby_dispatcher_address.
            - Backfills a set of records from an account and pushes them to PDH.
            - Move messages from ^deleted to ^all. This trigger will only undelete messages that were deleted before the fire time of the trigger. Also, messages whose blobs are already deleted will not be undeleted. This is an account trigger.
            - This trigger will undelete messages that were ^deleted arbitrarily long in the past and a trash label will be applied to these undeleted messages. This is an account trigger that will be written when the Vault admin enables end user access for the Vault customer. This trigger shares its implementation with the ACTION_MESSAGE_UNDELETE trigger.
            - Send the trigger to a groups server that implements the TriggerHandlerService. Dispatched via GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_groups_server_address.
            - This trigger will be executed once per newly created account. It will be created as part of the first transaction written to the account. The trigger can also be written as part of an SVF in case we want to re-initialize every account.
            - Send the trigger to an Observer server that implements the TriggerHandlerService for wipeout purpose. Dispatched via GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_observer_server_address. It behaves differently from the invoke observer trigger (ACTION_INVOKE_OBSERVER) and should be batched separately. Tingle always fires this kind of action trigger for ^deleted messages.
            - Begins the message expunge similar to ACTION_MESSAGE_EXPUNGE but doesn't check if the message was deleted at least 30 days back. To be used ONLY for service removal. See go/gmail-service-removal for more details.
            - Sends RPC to everclear for the message expunge.
            - Send the trigger to the S/MIME certificate issuer server. Dispatched via the GSLB target specified by FLAGS_triggers_smime_certificate_issuer_server_address.
            - The retention trigger that will be written to implement Groups retention.
            - Dispatches the permanent backup trigger to Satellite through Stubby dispatcher.
            - Process the debug log trigger by adding message body before dispatching to the Caribou Server through Stubby Dispatcher.
            - This trigger deletes expired temporary preferences. See go/tingle-temp-prefs for more details.
            - 'Similar to ACTION_QUERY_RETENTION but uses the MessageRetention policies to trash/delete the messages: cs/caribou/base/lib/proto/data_retention.proto .'
            - This trigger deletes expired HistoryRecords. See go/history-record-cleanup for more details.
            - This trigger relabels messages asynchronously. See go/fusebox-bulk-api for more details.
            - Dispatches the image processing trigger to Satellite through Stubby dispatcher. See go/gmail-photo-sharing for details.
            - Trigger for executing comparison logic between the output of ApplyDataRetention idle task and CaribouDataRetention trigger.
            - Trigger for backfill relevancy score. see go/gmail-relevancy-scoring-write for detail.
            - Trigger to backfill gaps left by pdh pushed via push notification. see go/tingle-moonshine-push-v2
            - Begins the message expunge similar to ACTION_MESSAGE_EXPUNGE but fires within one day. To be used ONLY for auto save drafts. See go/faster-auto-save-draft-deletion for more details.

      description: 'A union-like type for identifiying an object in storage. MultiKeys contain multiple key fields, each in a separate key space. At least one key field must be set. More than one key field may be set as long as all key values refer to the same object. All objects in storage have unique server_id keys. All MultiKeys returned from storage to storage clients will always have the server_id field set. When creating an object, if a MultiKey without a server_id is supplied to storage, the storage system will auto-assign a server ID to the new object. For all other storage requests (i.e. those not creating new objects), clients may omit server_id (as long as they supply another key). Instead of server ids, clients can specify string based client_assigned_perm_id keys. Mail message drafts are a prime example of these kinds of objects. Each time a user saves a new version of a draft, the storage system needs to create a new object with the updated draft content and needs to delete the object containing the old content. The new object gets a new SERVER_ID but should get the same CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID as the now-deleted object containing the old content. Carrying forward the perm ID allows it to be used to consistently refer to the same logical object across revisions. These perm IDs save sync clients from having to deal with changing object IDs. For example, assume there''s a mail message in storage with SERVER_ID = 123 and CLIENT_ASSIGNED_PERM_ID = "foo". The following are all valid ways of addressing the object using MultiKeys: 1) MultiKey { server_id = 123 } 2) MultiKey { server_id = 123, client_assigned_perm_id = "foo" } 3) MultiKey { client_assigned_perm_id = "foo" } Multikeys are never serialized in the storage. The individual keys are extracted and processed separately. Both the integer ids as well as string ids are indexed for efficient retrieval using the same fields in the backend. See go/tingle-multikeys for more information on background and motivation.'

For that email, there can be N items that are associated with the email (e.g. contacts, sales lead, meeting information). Each item is represented as a "card". A card has two views, collapsed and detailed. If there are more than 1 card, the cards are show as a list of collapsed views. The end user can expand into the detailed view for each of those cards. In the detailed view, developers have the freedom to use a variety of "widgets" to construct it. The model here is to restrict (make consistent for end users) the navigation of the N cards but providing developers the freedom to build the detailed view that can best represent their use case/content. Go http://go/aoig-widgets1 to see the mocks. Post v1, we plan to support new AddOn use cases that will require different and separate 'templates'. For example, a compose triggered AddOn which will support a new set of use cases with different user interaction patterns. As a result, we will likely need a very different template than this one.
