USE_SERVING_PORT: Provides an indirect method of specifying the health check port by referring to the backend service. Only supported by backend services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools. Not supported by backend services for pass-through load balancers. Supports all backends that can be health checked; for example, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups and instance group backends. For GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint group backends, the health check uses the port number specified for each endpoint in the network endpoint group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the port number determined by looking up the backend service''s named port in the instance group''s list of named ports.'

      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply: - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.'

A good metric to use with the target is for example pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances. A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency, since this value can''t include a chunk assignable to a single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target instead.'

This is referred to as the [initialization period](/compute/docs/autoscaler#cool_down_period). Specifying an accurate initialization period improves autoscaler decisions. For example, when scaling out, the autoscaler ignores data from VMs that are still initializing because those VMs might not yet represent normal usage of your application. The default initialization period is 60 seconds. Initialization periods might vary because of numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long your application takes to initialize. To do this, create a VM and time your application''s startup process.'

The disks resource represents a zonal persistent disk. For more information, read Zonal persistent disks. The regionDisks resource represents a regional persistent disk. For more information, read Regional resources.'

      description: 'Flags the specified instances to be immediately removed from the managed instance group. Abandoning an instance does not delete the instance, but it does remove the instance from any target pools that are applied by the managed instance group. This method reduces the targetSize of the managed instance group by the number of instances that you abandon. This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted. You can specify a maximum of 1000 instances with this method per request.'

This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`. '

This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`. '
