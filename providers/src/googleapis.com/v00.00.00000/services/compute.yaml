    Policy:
      id: Policy
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
        roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
        user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer

      properties:
        version:
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when
            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule
            consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and
            potentially multiple user-defined match fields
            ('userDefinedFields'). Field values may be extracted directly from
            the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields
            may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined
            field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and
            the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which
            values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact
            values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must
            be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match
            values are specified for a match field, then any field value is
            considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For
            strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet
            to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the
            corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example:
            networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24"
            userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: -
            "1-0x1fff" The above match condition matches packets with a source
            IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named
            "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.

            The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The

            type of INT64 or DOUBLE.

        filter:
          description: >-
            A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
            string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
            specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
            whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For
            the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules
            apply: - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. -
            You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any
            functions for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both
            the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in
            both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource
            type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If
            it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a
            separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case,
            you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any
            other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values
            that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource
            label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct
            TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for
            the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to
            gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to
            pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the
            instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
            TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
            will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

            machines handling requests to increase or decrease proportionally to
            the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
            utilization_target is
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
            The autoscaler works to keep this value constant for each of the

            Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the value
            of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to group
            resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
            pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a
            custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your
            instances. A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or
            median latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to
            a single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target

            reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by
            reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
            CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
            responses with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the

              Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check reported
              weights. If set, the Backend Service must configure a non legacy
              HTTP-based Health Check, and health check replies are expected to
              contain non-standard HTTP response header field
              X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the per-instance
              weights. If set, Load Balancing is weighted based on the
              per-instance weights reported in the last processed health check
              replies, as long as every instance either reported a valid weight
              or had UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
              equal-weight. This option is only supported in Network Load
              Balancing.

            the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While
            creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required
            under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to
            targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the
            IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private
            Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress.
            Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references
            an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted,
            Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the
            following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
            forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6
            address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
            project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by
            name, as in: -

            regions/region/addresses/address-name -
            global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's
            target or backendService, and in most cases, also the
            loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can
            use. For detailed information, see [IP address

            /29 and /30 IPv4 subnet lengths. If a remote cloud has no constraint
            on IPv4 subnet length, the range would thus be {min: 29, max: 30}.

              allocations. This occurs with Cross-Cloud Interconnect to Azure
              remote locations. While GCP's API does not explicitly group pairs
              of ports, the UI uses this field to ensure matching VLAN ids when
              configuring a redundant VLAN pair.

            PORT_PAIR_MATCHING_REMOTE_LOCATION. Google Cloud API refers only to
            individual ports, but the UI uses this field when ordering a pair of
            ports, to prevent users from accidentally ordering something that is
            incompatible with their cloud provider. Specifically, when ordering
            a redundant pair of Cross-Cloud Interconnect ports, and one of them
            uses a remote location with portPairMatchingRemoteLocation set to
            matching, the UI requires that both ports use the same remote
            location.

        tlsEarlyData:

Early Data allows a TLS resumption handshake to include the initial application payload (a HTTP request) alongside the handshake, reducing the effective round trips to "zero". This applies to TLS 1.3 connections over TCP (HTTP/2) as well as over UDP (QUIC/h3). This can improve application performance, especially on networks where interruptions may be common, such as on mobile. Requests with Early Data will have the "Early-Data" HTTP header set on the request, with a value of "1", to allow the backend to determine whether Early Data was included. Note: TLS Early Data may allow requests to be replayed, as the data is sent to the backend before the handshake has fully completed. Applications that allow idempotent HTTP methods to make non-idempotent changes, such as a GET request updating a database, should not accept Early Data on those requests, and reject requests with the "Early-Data: 1" HTTP header by returning a HTTP 425 (Too Early) status code, in order to remain RFC compliant.

        passthrough Network Load Balancers. A target pool references member
        instances, an associated legacy HttpHealthCheck resource, and,
        optionally, a backup target pool. For more information, read Using
        target pools.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent
        storage, and allows you to resume the instance at a later time.
        Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only
        storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged
        resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and
        static IP addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is
        suspended. For more information, see Suspending and resuming an

        Resizes the managed instance group. If you increase the size, the group

        decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is

        status of the creating or deleting actions with the listmanagedinstances
        method. When resizing down, the instance group arbitrarily chooses the
        order in which VMs are deleted. The group takes into account some VM
        attributes when making the selection including: + The status of the VM
        instance. + The health of the VM instance. + The instance template
        version the VM is based on. + For regional managed instance groups, the
        location of the VM instance. This list is subject to change. If the
        group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining,
        it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has
        elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

        Returns the specified Project resource. To decrease latency for this
        method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the
        response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended
        for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or
        more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include
        the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and
        `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your
        request.

        Retrieves the list of region resources available to the specified
        project. To decrease latency for this method, you can optionally omit
        any unneeded information from the response by using a field mask. This
        practice is especially recommended for unused quota information (the
        `items.quotas` field). To exclude one or more fields, set your request's
        `fields` query parameter to only include the fields you need. For
        example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query
        parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request. This method fails if
        the quota information is unavailable for the region and if the
        organization policy constraint compute.requireBasicQuotaInResponse is
        enforced. This constraint, when enforced, disables the fail-open
        behaviour when quota information (the `items.quotas` field) is
        unavailable for the region. It is recommended to use the default setting
        for the constraint unless your application requires the fail-closed
        behaviour for this method.
