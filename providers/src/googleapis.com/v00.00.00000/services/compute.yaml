            - The response to a Health Check probe had the HTTP response header field X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight, but its content was invalid (i.e., not a non-negative single-precision floating-point number in decimal string representation).
            - The response to a Health Check probe did not have the HTTP response header field X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight.
            - This is the value when the accompanied health status is either TIMEOUT (i.e.,the Health Check probe was not able to get a response in time) or UNKNOWN. For the latter, it should be typically because there has not been sufficient time to parse and report the weight for a new backend (which is with 0.0.0.0 ip address). However, it can be also due to an outage case for which the health status is explicitly reset to UNKNOWN.
            - This is the default value when WeightReportMode is DISABLE, and is also the initial value when WeightReportMode has just updated to ENABLE or DRY_RUN and there has not been sufficient time to parse and report the backend weight.

For cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present.

The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-max-age) of a cached response.

Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/ project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by name, as in: - projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule''s target or backendService, and in most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can use.

A good metric to use with the target is for example pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances. A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target instead.

This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply: - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.'

            - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
            - This algorithm implements consistent hashing to backends. Maglev can be used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
            - Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer.
            - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
            - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests.

          description: Specifies the maximum duration (timeout) for streams on the selected route. Unlike the timeout field where the timeout duration starts from the time the request has been fully processed (known as *end-of-stream*), the duration in this field is computed from the beginning of the stream until the response has been processed, including all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If not specified, this field uses the maximum maxStreamDuration value among all backend services associated with the route. This field is only allowed if the Url map is used with backend services with loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

          description: 'The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: Routing and traffic management features.'
        timeout:
          description: Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed from the time the request has been fully processed (known as *end-of-stream*) up until the response has been processed. Timeout includes all retries. If not specified, this field uses the largest timeout among all backend services associated with the route.

The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number. After a backend service is identified and before forwarding the request to the backend service, advanced routing actions such as URL rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on additional settings specified in this HttpRouteAction.

      description: 'Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the 2 minutes and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`. '

      description: Updates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in the request. This operation is marked as DONE when the group is patched even if the instances in the group are still in the process of being patched. You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listmanagedinstances method. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

This operation is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have not yet been removed from the group.

For example, to only include the `id` and `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your request.

This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`. '

You must separately verify the status of the individual instances with the listManagedInstances method. This method supports PATCH semantics and uses the JSON merge patch format and processing rules. If you update your group to specify a new template or instance configuration, it's possible that your intended specification for each VM in the group is different from the current state of that VM. To learn how to apply an updated configuration to the VMs in a MIG, see Updating instances in a MIG.

This method differs from the `GET` method in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`. '
