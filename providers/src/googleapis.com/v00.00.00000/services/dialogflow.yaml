      description: >-
        A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized
        as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages.
        For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can
        handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for.
        At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current
        page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is
        considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow
        initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page.
        For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same
        or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect
        information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational
        state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).

        Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational
        agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The
        approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is
        present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated,
        and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the
        OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
        concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated
        as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally
        use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. *
        Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result
        is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more
        sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the
        user may differ from what is heard.

      description: >-
        A transition route specifies a intent that can be matched and/or a data
        condition that can be evaluated during a session. When a specified
        transition is matched, the following actions are taken in order: * If
        there is a `trigger_fulfillment` associated with the transition, it will
        be called. * If there is a `target_page` associated with the transition,
        the session will transition into the specified page. * If there is a
        `target_flow` associated with the transition, the session will
        transition into the specified flow.

        Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot
        agent. A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes.
        Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0
        ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the
        current flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow
        is finished, Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow,
        where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a transition route is
        followed by a matched intent, the intent will be "consumed". This means
        the intent won't activate more transition routes. However, when the
        followed transition route moves the conversation session into a
        different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be
        consumed in the target flow.

        Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
        meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
        such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
        actionable data for your application. When you define an entity, you can
        also include synonyms that all map to that entity. For example, "soft
        drink", "soda", "pop", and so on. There are three types of entities: *
        **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
        data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
        represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are
        defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your
        application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for
        red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different
        types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different
        toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType`
        type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such
        as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
        represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about
        entity types, see the [Dialogflow

              [`FLAC`](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation.html) (Free Lossless
              Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding because it is lossless
              (therefore recognition is not compromised) and requires only about
              half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream encoding supports
              16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in `STREAMINFO`
              are supported.

              Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very
              low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred
              over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding
              supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in
              MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the
              RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
              5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a
              sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts
              with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed
              by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number
              of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each
              RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block
              length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must
              be 16000.

        return a detected utterance at a proper time while the client is playing
        back the response audio from a previous request. When the client sees
        the utterance, it should stop the playback and immediately get ready for
        receiving the responses for the current request. The barge-in handling
        requires the client to start streaming audio input as soon as it starts
        playing back the audio from the previous response. The playback is
        modeled into two phases: * No barge-in phase: which goes first and
        during which speech detection should not be carried out. * Barge-in
        phase: which follows the no barge-in phase and during which the API
        starts speech detection and may inform the client that an utterance has
        been detected. Note that no-speech event is not expected in this phase.
        The client provides this configuration in terms of the durations of
        those two phases. The durations are measured in terms of the audio
        length from the start of the input audio. No-speech event is a response

        present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated,
        and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the
        OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
        concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated
        as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally
        use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. *
        Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result
        is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more
        sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the
        user may differ from what is heard.

              [`FLAC`](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation.html) (Free Lossless
              Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding because it is lossless
              (therefore recognition is not compromised) and requires only about
              half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream encoding supports
              16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in `STREAMINFO`
              are supported.

              Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very
              low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred
              over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding
              supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in
              MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the
              RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
              5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a
              sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts
              with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed
              by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number
              of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each
              RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block
              length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must
              be 16000.

        Configuration of the barge-in behavior. Barge-in instructs the API to
        return a detected utterance at a proper time while the client is playing
        back the response audio from a previous request. When the client sees
        the utterance, it should stop the playback and immediately get ready for
        receiving the responses for the current request. The barge-in handling
        requires the client to start streaming audio input as soon as it starts
        playing back the audio from the previous response. The playback is
        modeled into two phases: * No barge-in phase: which goes first and
        during which speech detection should not be carried out. * Barge-in
        phase: which follows the no barge-in phase and during which the API
        starts speech detection and may inform the client that an utterance has
        been detected. Note that no-speech event is not expected in this phase.
        The client provides this configuration in terms of the durations of
        those two phases. The durations are measured in terms of the audio
        length from the start of the input audio. No-speech event is a response

        A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized
        as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages.
        For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can
        handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for.
        At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current
        page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is
        considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow
        initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page.
        For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same
        or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect
        information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational
        state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).

            Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part
            boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts
            are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be
            annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the
            Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase,
            you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are
            populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`,

    GoogleCloudDialogflowV2Context:
      id: GoogleCloudDialogflowV2Context
      description: >-
        Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person
        says to you "they are orange", you need context in order to understand
        what "they" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
        end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in
        order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the
        flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by
        setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names.
        When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that
        intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more
        likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that
        correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about
        context, see the [Contexts
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

            `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`. The
            `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain
            characters in `a-zA-Z0-9_-%` and may be at most 250 bytes long. If
            `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default 'draft'
            environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default '-'
            user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by
            Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts
            with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` *
            `*_dialog_params_size`

            parameter value.

        Contains a speech recognition result corresponding to a portion of the
        audio that is currently being processed or an indication that this is
        the end of the single requested utterance. While end-user audio is being
        processed, Dialogflow sends a series of results. Each result may contain
        a `transcript` value. A transcript represents a portion of the
        utterance. While the recognizer is processing audio, transcript values
        may be interim values or finalized values. Once a transcript is
        finalized, the `is_final` value is set to true and processing continues
        for the next transcript. If
        `StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_input.audio_config.single_utterance`
        was true, and the recognizer has completed processing audio, the
        `message_type` value is set to `END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE and the
        following (last) result contains the last finalized transcript. The
        complete end-user utterance is determined by concatenating the finalized
        transcript values received for the series of results. In the following
        example, single utterance is enabled. In the case where single utterance
        is not enabled, result 7 would not occur. ``` Num | transcript |
        message_type | is_final --- | ----------------------- |
        ----------------------- | -------- 1 | "tube" | TRANSCRIPT | false 2 |
        "to be a" | TRANSCRIPT | false 3 | "to be" | TRANSCRIPT | false 4 | "to
        be or not to be" | TRANSCRIPT | true 5 | "that's" | TRANSCRIPT | false 6
        | "that is | TRANSCRIPT | false 7 | unset | END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE |
        unset 8 | " that is the question" | TRANSCRIPT | true ``` Concatenating
        the finalized transcripts with `is_final` set to true, the complete
        utterance becomes "to be or not to be that is the question".

      description: >-
        Each intent parameter has a type, called the entity type, which dictates
        exactly how data from an end-user expression is extracted. Dialogflow
        provides predefined system entities that can match many common types of
        data. For example, there are system entities for matching dates, times,
        colors, email addresses, and so on. You can also create your own custom
        entities for matching custom data. For example, you could define a
        vegetable entity that can match the types of vegetables available for
        purchase with a grocery store agent. For more information, see the
        [Entity

        An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn.
        For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can
        handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes or says
        something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user input,
        Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in your agent.
        Matching an intent is also known as intent classification. For more
        information, see the [intent

              contain @-prefixed entity type names as substrings. Note: Template
              mode has been deprecated. Example mode is the only supported way
              to create new training phrases. If you have existing training
              phrases in template mode, they will be removed during training and
              it can cause a drop in agent performance.

        parts:
          description: >-
            Required. The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are
            concatenated in order to form the training phrase. Note: The API
            does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow
            Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part
            boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts
            are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be
            annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the
            Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase,
            you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are
            populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that you want to annotate, and the `entity_type`, `alias`,
            and `user_defined` fields are all set.

    GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1Context:
      id: GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1Context
      description: >-
        Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person
        says to you "they are orange", you need context in order to understand
        what "they" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
        end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in
        order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the
        flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by
        setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names.
        When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that
        intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more
        likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that
        correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about
        context, see the [Contexts
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).
      type: object
      properties:
        name:

            `projects//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`, -
            `projects//locations//agent/environments//users//sessions//contexts/`,
            The `Context ID` is always converted to lowercase, may only contain
            characters in `a-zA-Z0-9_-%` and may be at most 250 bytes long. If
            `Environment ID` is not specified, we assume default 'draft'
            environment. If `User ID` is not specified, we assume default '-'
            user. The following context names are reserved for internal use by
            Dialogflow. You should not use these contexts or create contexts
            with these names: * `__system_counters__` * `*_id_dialog_context` *
            `*_dialog_params_size`

            otherwise, depending on the parameter value type, it could be one of
            string, number, boolean, null, list or map. * MapValue value: If
            parameter's entity type is a composite entity then use map from
            composite entity property names to property values, otherwise, use
            parameter value.

        Contains a speech recognition result corresponding to a portion of the
        audio that is currently being processed or an indication that this is
        the end of the single requested utterance. While end-user audio is being
        processed, Dialogflow sends a series of results. Each result may contain
        a `transcript` value. A transcript represents a portion of the
        utterance. While the recognizer is processing audio, transcript values
        may be interim values or finalized values. Once a transcript is
        finalized, the `is_final` value is set to true and processing continues
        for the next transcript. If
        `StreamingDetectIntentRequest.query_input.audio_config.single_utterance`
        was true, and the recognizer has completed processing audio, the
        `message_type` value is set to `END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE and the
        following (last) result contains the last finalized transcript. The
        complete end-user utterance is determined by concatenating the finalized
        transcript values received for the series of results. In the following
        example, single utterance is enabled. In the case where single utterance
        is not enabled, result 7 would not occur. ``` Num | transcript |
        message_type | is_final --- | ----------------------- |
        ----------------------- | -------- 1 | "tube" | TRANSCRIPT | false 2 |
        "to be a" | TRANSCRIPT | false 3 | "to be" | TRANSCRIPT | false 4 | "to
        be or not to be" | TRANSCRIPT | true 5 | "that's" | TRANSCRIPT | false 6
        | "that is | TRANSCRIPT | false 7 | unset | END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE |
        unset 8 | " that is the question" | TRANSCRIPT | true ``` Concatenating
        the finalized transcripts with `is_final` set to true, the complete
        utterance becomes "to be or not to be that is the question".

              This event indicates that the server has detected the end of the

              Therefore, the server will not process additional audio (although
              it may subsequently return additional results). The client should
              stop sending additional audio data, half-close the gRPC
              connection, and wait for any additional results until the server
              closes the gRPC connection. This message is only sent if

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
