        `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the
        necessary attributes to use Google Cloud services) and
        `ServicePerimeters` (which define regions of services able to freely
        pass data within a perimeter). An access policy is globally visible
        within an organization, and the restrictions it specifies apply to all
        projects within an organization.

            The scopes of the AccessPolicy. Scopes define which resources a
            policy can restrict and where its resources can be referenced. For
            example, policy A with `scopes=["folders/123"]` has the following
            behavior: - ServicePerimeter can only restrict projects within
            `folders/123`. - ServicePerimeter within policy A can only reference
            access levels defined within policy A. - Only one policy can include
            a given scope; thus, attempting to create a second policy which
            includes `folders/123` will result in an error. If no scopes are
            provided, then any resource within the organization can be

        Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this
        resource. `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud
        Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`,
        `Projects`) that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values`
        and `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and
        optional `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource
        subtree values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and
        is required only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:"
        are treated the same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be
        in one of the following formats: - "projects/", e.g.
        "projects/tokyo-rain-123" - "folders/", e.g. "folders/1234" -
        "organizations/", e.g. "organizations/1234" The `supports_under` field
        of the associated `Constraint` defines whether ancestry prefixes can be
        used. You can set `allowed_values` and `denied_values` in the same
        `Policy` if `all_values` is `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY`
        are used to allow or deny all values. If `all_values` is set to either
        `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values` and `denied_values` must be unset.

          description: >-
            Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`. By default, a
            `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set anywhere
            up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is set
            to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
            resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
            added to the values inherited up the hierarchy. Setting `Policy`
            hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't
            recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple
            and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
            `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values`
            set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in
            `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example,
            suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`,
            which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with
            `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the
            Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed
            API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a
            project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to
            `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to
            activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate
            different possible layerings for `projects/bar` parented by
            `organizations/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values):
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
            "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent`
            `false` and values: {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"} The
            accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted
            values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`. Example 2 (inherited
            values): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
            {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has a
            `Policy` with values: {value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent:
            true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The
            accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.
            Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
            "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
            {denied_values: "E1"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are
            `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`. Example 4
            (RestoreDefault): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
            {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"} `projects/bar` has a
            `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at
            `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at
            `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of
            `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5
            (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations/foo` has no
            `Policy` set. `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted
            values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value
            of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example
            6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
            with values: {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}
            `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values
            at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at
            `projects/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
            "E1" allowed_values: "E2"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all:
            DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No
            value is accepted at `projects/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied
            subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following
            resource hierarchy O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3},
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values:
            "under:organizations/O1"} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
            {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"} {denied_values:
            "under:folders/F2"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are
            `organizations/O1`, `folders/F1`, `folders/F2`, `projects/P1`,
            `projects/P2`, `projects/P3`. The accepted values at `projects/bar`

            to non-partitioned table(s). [force] will decide whether to
            overwrite existing table(s). If [partition_spec] is specified.
            First, the snapshot results will be written to partitioned table(s)
            with two additional timestamp columns, readTime and requestTime, one
            of which will be the partition key. Secondly, in the case when any
            destination table already exists, it will first try to update
            existing table's schema as necessary by appending additional
            columns. Then, if [force] is `TRUE`, the corresponding partition
            will be overwritten by the snapshot results (data in different
            partitions will remain intact); if [force] is unset or `FALSE`, it
            will append the data. An error will be returned if the schema update

            flag is `FALSE` or unset and the destination table already exists,
            the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
        separateTablesPerAssetType:
          description: >-
            If this flag is `TRUE`, the snapshot results will be written to one
            or multiple tables, each of which contains results of one asset
            type. The [force] and [partition_spec] fields will apply to each of
            them. Field [table] will be concatenated with "_" and the asset type
            names (see
            https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types
            for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table names,
            in which all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and "/" will be
            substituted by "_". Example: if field [table] is "mytable" and
            snapshot results contain "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the
            corresponding table name will be
            "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket". If any of these tables does
            not exist, a new table with the concatenated name will be created.
            When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is `RESOURCE`, the
            schema of each table will include RECORD-type columns mapped to the
            nested fields in the Asset.resource.data field of that asset type
            (up to the 15 nested level BigQuery supports
            (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)).
            The fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON format string
            as a child column of its parent RECORD column. If error occurs when
            exporting to any table, the whole export call will return an error
            but the export results that already succeed will persist. Example:
            if exporting to table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B
            fails during one export call, the results in table_type_A will
            persist and there will not be partial results persisting in a table.

        `ServicePerimeter` has a target outside of the `ServicePerimeter`, the
        request will be blocked. Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two
        types of Service Perimeter - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service
        Perimeters cannot overlap, a single Google Cloud project or VPC network
        can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service Perimeter
        Bridges can contain only Google Cloud projects as members, a single

            iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account

            Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to
            a Google Cloud folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has
            iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and

              Too Many Requests
            - >-
              The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
              non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
              guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
              `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just
              the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at
              a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set
              fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write
              sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
              retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For
              example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
              `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should
              not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
              Mapping: 400 Bad Request
            - >-
              The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
              such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
              guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
            - >-
              The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
              indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.
              For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
              if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1],
              but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an
              offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
              using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so
              that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for
              an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP

          description: >-
            If `true`, then the `Policy` is enforced. If `false`, then any
            configuration is acceptable. Suppose you have a `Constraint`
            `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with
            `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that
            `Constraint` exhibits the following behavior: - If the `Policy` at
            this resource has enforced set to `false`, serial port connection
            attempts will be allowed. - If the `Policy` at this resource has
            enforced set to `true`, serial port connection attempts will be
            refused. - If the `Policy` at this resource is `RestoreDefault`,
            serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is
            set at this resource or anywhere higher in the resource hierarchy,
            serial port connection attempts will be allowed. - If no `Policy` is
            set at this resource, but one exists higher in the resource
            hierarchy, the behavior is as if the`Policy` were set at this
            resource. The following examples demonstrate the different possible
            layerings: Example 1 (nearest `Constraint` wins):
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: false}
            `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint at `projects/bar`
            and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced. Example 2 (enforcement
            gets replaced): `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced:
            false} `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true} The
            constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced. The constraint at
            `projects/bar` is enforced. Example 3 (RestoreDefault):
            `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with: {enforced: true}
            `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with: {RestoreDefault: {}} The
            constraint at `organizations/foo` is enforced. The constraint at
            `projects/bar` is not enforced, because `constraint_default` for the
            `Constraint` is `ALLOW`.

    Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",

        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -

            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to

        etag:

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

        Analyzes IAM policies asynchronously to answer which identities have
        what accesses on which resources, and writes the analysis results to a
        Google Cloud Storage or a BigQuery destination. For Cloud Storage
        destination, the output format is the JSON format that represents a
        AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse. This method implements the
        google.longrunning.Operation, which allows you to track the operation
        status. We recommend intervals of at least 2 seconds with exponential
        backoff retry to poll the operation result. The metadata contains the
        metadata for the long-running operation.

        Exports assets with time and resource types to a given Cloud Storage
        location/BigQuery table. For Cloud Storage location destinations, the
        output format is newline-delimited JSON. Each line represents a
        google.cloud.asset.v1.Asset in the JSON format; for BigQuery table
        destinations, the output table stores the fields in asset Protobuf as
        columns. This API implements the google.longrunning.Operation API, which
        allows you to keep track of the export. We recommend intervals of at
        least 2 seconds with exponential retry to poll the export operation
        result. For regular-size resource parent, the export operation usually
        finishes within 5 minutes.

        Batch gets the update history of assets that overlap a time window. For
        IAM_POLICY content, this API outputs history when the asset and its
        attached IAM POLICY both exist. This can create gaps in the output
        history. Otherwise, this API outputs history with asset in both
        non-delete or deleted status. If a specified asset does not exist, this
        API returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
