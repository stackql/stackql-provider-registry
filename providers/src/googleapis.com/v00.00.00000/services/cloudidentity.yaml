This method must be called with end-user credentials with the scope: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.devices.lookup If multiple properties are provided, only DeviceUsers having all of these properties are considered as matches - i.e. the query behaves like an AND. Different platforms require different amounts of information from the caller to ensure that the DeviceUser is uniquely identified. - iOS: No properties need to be passed, the caller''s credentials are sufficient to identify the corresponding DeviceUser. - Android: Specifying the ''android_id'' field is required. - Desktop: Specifying the ''raw_resource_id'' field is required.'
