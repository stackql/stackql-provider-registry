            Member Restriction as defined by CEL expression. Supported
            restrictions are: `member.customer_id` and `member.type`. Valid
            values for `member.type` are `1`, `2` and `3`. They correspond to
            USER, SERVICE_ACCOUNT, and GROUP respectively. The value for
            `member.customer_id` only supports `groupCustomerId()` currently
            which means the customer id of the group will be used for
            restriction. Supported operators are `&&`, `||` and `==`,
            corresponding to AND, OR, and EQUAL. Examples: Allow only service
            accounts of given customer to be members. `member.type == 2 &&
            member.customer_id == groupCustomerId()` Allow only users or groups
            to be members. `member.type == 1 || member.type == 3`
