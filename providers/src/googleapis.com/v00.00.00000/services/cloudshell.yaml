              Startup is waiting for the user's disk to be unarchived. This can
              happen when the user returns to Cloud Shell after not having used
              it for a while, and suggests that startup will take longer than
              normal.

              Startup is waiting for compute resources to be assigned to the
              environment. This should normally happen very quickly, but an
              environment might stay in this state for an extended period of
              time if the system is experiencing heavy load.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
