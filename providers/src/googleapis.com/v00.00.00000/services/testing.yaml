            - 'The test APK does not contain the test runner class specified by user or in the manifest file.

            - The zipped XCTest was built for the iOS simulator rather than for a physical device.
            - The .xctestrun file did not specify any test targets.
            - One or more of the test targets defined in the .xctestrun file specifies "UseDestinationArtifacts", which is disallowed.
            - XC tests which run on physical devices must have "IsAppHostedTestBundle" == "true" in the xctestrun file.
            - An Info.plist file in the XCTest zip could not be parsed.
            - The APK is marked as "testOnly". Deprecated and not currently used.
