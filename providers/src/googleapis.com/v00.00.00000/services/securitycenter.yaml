              Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by
              an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
              to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
              additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
              Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and
              public SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute
              unauthorized code within existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
              and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order
              to gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
              exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and
              privileges to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a
              database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible
              internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor
              that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to create new computational resources in an
              environment but not able to access data or execute code in
              existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
              actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them
              to eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain
              access and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate
              data. An example is a service account with access to more projects
              than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service
              account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a
              project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates
              a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not
              access data or execute unauthorized code.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
              organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats
              in their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of
              security issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled
              for resource configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat
              that has obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able
              to access data, execute code, or create resources.

      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
            expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via
            logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and
            `OR` has higher precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form `
            ` and may have a `-` character in front of them to indicate
            negation. Examples include: * name * source_properties.a_property *
            security_marks.marks.marka The supported operators are: * `=` for
            all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` for integer values. * `:`,
            meaning substring matching, for strings. The supported value types
            are: * string literals in quotes. * integer literals without quotes.
            * boolean literals `true` and `false` without quotes. The following
            field and operator combinations are supported: * name: `=` * parent:
            `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:` * category:
            `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`,
            `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339
            string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
            `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state:
            `=`, `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`,
            `:`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size =
            100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial match on the empty
            string to filter based on a property existing:
            `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
            the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
            `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: * resource.name:

            When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's "state_change"
            attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had its state
            changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the finding
            was added during the compare_duration period of time that precedes
            the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
            compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived
            based on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in
            time. Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect
            the result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding
            is made inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change"
            values when compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates
            that the finding was present and matched the given filter at the
            start of compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. *
            "UNCHANGED": indicates that the finding was present and matched the
            given filter at the start of compare_duration and did not change
            state at read_time. * "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not
            match the given filter or was not present at the start of
            compare_duration, but was present at read_time. * "REMOVED":
            indicates that the finding was present and matched the filter at the
            start of compare_duration, but did not match the filter at
            read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the only
            possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
            set for all findings present at read_time. If this field is set then

              Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by
              an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
              to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
              additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
              Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and
              public SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute
              unauthorized code within existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
              and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order
              to gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
              exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and
              privileges to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a
              database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible
              internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor
              that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to create new computational resources in an
              environment but not able to access data or execute code in
              existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
              actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them
              to eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain
              access and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate
              data. An example is a service account with access to more projects
              than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service
              account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a
              project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates
              a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not
              access data or execute unauthorized code.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
              organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats
              in their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of
              security issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled
              for resource configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat
              that has obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able
              to access data, execute code, or create resources.

              The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set
              of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed
              below, up to and including the entire Internet.
            - >-
              The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the
              attack is limited at the protocol level to a logically adjacent
              topology.
            - >-
              The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the
              attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.
            - >-
              The attack requires the attacker to physically touch or manipulate
              the vulnerable component.

              Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not
              exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking
              the vulnerable component.
            - >-
              A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's
              control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at
              will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable
              amount of effort in preparation or execution against the
              vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

              not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable
              system to carry out an attack.
            - >-
              The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user
              capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files
              owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges
              has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.
            - >-
              The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g.,
              administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing
              access to component-wide settings and files.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
