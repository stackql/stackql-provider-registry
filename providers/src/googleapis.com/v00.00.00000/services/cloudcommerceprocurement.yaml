          description: Output only. The state of the entitlement.
          enumDescriptions:
            - >-
              Default state of the entitlement. It's only set to this value when
              the entitlement is first created and has not been initialized.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement has been created, but it hasn't yet
              become active. The entitlement remains in this state until it
              becomes active. If the entitlement requires provider approval, a
              notification is sent to the provider for the activation approval.
              If the provider doesn't approve, the entitlement is removed. If
              approved, the entitlement transitions to the
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE state after either a short
              processing delay or, if applicable, at the scheduled start time of
              the purchased offer. Plan changes aren't allowed in this state.
              Instead, customers are expected to cancel the corresponding order
              and place a new order.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement is active. The procured item is now
              usable and any associated billing events will start occurring.
              Entitlements in this state WILL renew. The analogous state for an
              unexpired but non-renewing entitlement is
              ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION. In this state, the customer can
              decide to cancel the entitlement, which would change the state to
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_CANCELLATION, and then
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED. The user can also request
              a change of plan, which will transition the state to
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE, and then back to
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement will expire at the end of its term.
              This could mean the customer has elected not to renew this
              entitlement or the customer elected to cancel an entitlement that
              only expires at term end. The entitlement typically stays in this
              state if the entitlement/plan allows use of the underlying
              resource until the end of the current billing cycle. Once the
              billing cycle completes, the resource will transition to
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_CANCELLED state. The resource cannot
              be modified during this state.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement was cancelled. The entitlement can
              now be deleted.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a
              pending plan change that is requested by the customer. The
              entitlement typically stays in this state, if the entitlement/plan
              requires the completion of the current billing cycle before the
              plan can be changed. Once the billing cycle completes, the
              resource will transition to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE,
              with its plan changed.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement is currently active, but there is a
              plan change request pending provider approval. If the provider
              approves the plan change, then the entitlement will transition
              either to EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE or
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_PENDING_PLAN_CHANGE depending on
              whether current plan requires that the billing cycle completes. If
              the provider rejects the plan change, then the pending plan change
              request is removed and the entitlement stays in
              EntitlementState.ENTITLEMENT_ACTIVE state with the old plan.
            - >-
              Indicates that the entitlement is suspended either by Google or
              provider request. This can be triggered for various external
              reasons (e.g. expiration of credit card on the billing account,
              violation of terms-of-service of the provider etc.). As such, any
              remediating action needs to be taken externally, before the
              entitlement can be activated. This is not yet supported.
