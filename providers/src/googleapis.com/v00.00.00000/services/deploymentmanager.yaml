            regular expression of `a-z+` but should ideally be lowerCamelCase.
            Also, they must be limited to 64 characters in length. When
            identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units should
            be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than
            `{"instanceLimit": "100/request"}`, should be returned as,
            `{"instanceLimitPerRequest": "100"}`, if the client exceeds the

            is generated by some common infrastructure, the error domain must be
            a globally unique value that identifies the infrastructure. For
            Google API infrastructure, the error domain is "googleapis.com".

        [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations)
        * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations)
        You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests.
        For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be
        global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the
        `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the
        `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the
        `zoneOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional,
        and Zonal Resources. Note that completed Operation resources have a
        limited retention period.

            Provides a fingerprint to use in requests to modify a deployment,
            such as `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests. A
            fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with
            `update()`, `stop()`, and `cancelPreview()` requests to perform
            optimistic locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only
            one request happens at a time. The fingerprint is initially
            generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to
            modify data. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a `get()`
            request to a deployment.

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call

      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":

        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
