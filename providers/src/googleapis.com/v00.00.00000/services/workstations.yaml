          description: >-
            Optional. Whether to enable nested virtualization on Cloud
            Workstations VMs created using this workstation configuration.
            Defaults to false. Nested virtualization lets you run virtual
            machine (VM) instances inside your workstation. Before enabling
            nested virtualization, consider the following important
            considerations. Cloud Workstations instances are subject to the
            [same restrictions as Compute Engine
            instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions):
            * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or organizations may
            be restricted from creating nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested
            virtualization** constraint is enforced in the organization policy.
            For more information, see the Compute Engine section, [Checking
            whether nested virtualization is
            allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed).
            * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater
            decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and
            possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are
            input/output bound. * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can
            only be enabled on workstation configurations that specify a
            machine_type in the N1 or N2 machine series.

            Access and you use `private.googleapis.com` or
            `restricted.googleapis.com` for Container Registry and Artifact
            Registry, make sure that you set up DNS records for domains
            `*.gcr.io` and `*.pkg.dev`. Defaults to false (VMs have public IP
            addresses).

            Optional. Number of seconds that a workstation can run until it is
            automatically shut down. We recommend that workstations be shut down
            daily to reduce costs and so that security updates can be applied
            upon restart. The idle_timeout and running_timeout fields are
            independent of each other. Note that the running_timeout field shuts
            down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not the
            VMs are idle. Provide duration terminated by `s` for seconds—for
            example, `"54000s"` (15 hours). Defaults to `"43200s"` (12 hours). A
            value of `"0s"` indicates that workstations using this configuration
            should never time out. If encryption_key is set, it must be greater
            than `"0s"` and less than `"86400s"` (24 hours). Warning: A value of
            `"0s"` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this
            configuration have no maximum running time. This is strongly
            discouraged because you incur costs and will not pick up security
            updates.

            disks are encrypted using a generated key. Customer-managed
            encryption keys do not protect disk metadata. If the
            customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation
            instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the persistent
            disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep older versions
            of the key until the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data
            on the persistent disk might be lost. If the encryption key is
            revoked, the workstation session automatically stops within 7 hours.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            false. Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM)
            instances inside your workstation. Before enabling nested
            virtualization, consider the following important considerations.
            Cloud Workstations instances are subject to the [same restrictions
            as Compute Engine
            instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/overview#restrictions):
            * **Organization policy**: projects, folders, or organizations may
            be restricted from creating nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested
            virtualization** constraint is enforced in the organization policy.
            For more information, see the Compute Engine section, [Checking
            whether nested virtualization is
            allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/managing-constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed).
            * **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater
            decrease in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and
            possibly greater than a 10% decrease for workloads that are
            input/output bound. * **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can
            only be enabled on boost configurations that specify a machine_type
            in the N1 or N2 machine series.

          description: >-

            types](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/available-machine-types).

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
