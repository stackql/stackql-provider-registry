        Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface. Interfaces are
        also described as "protocol buffer services" in some contexts, such as
        by the "service" keyword in a .proto file, but they are different from
        API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface
        as opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are
        also sometimes simply referred to as "APIs" in other contexts, such as
        the name of this message itself. See
        https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for detailed terminology.
        New usages of this message as an alternative to ServiceDescriptorProto
        are strongly discouraged. This message does not reliability preserve all

            package name will be verified to be consistent with what is provided

            non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what
            to expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen
            based on the product plan. The major version is also reflected in
            the package name of the interface, which must end in `v`, as in
            `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be
            omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental,

        Declares an API Interface to be included in this interface. The
        including interface must redeclare all the methods from the included
        interface, but documentation and options are inherited as follows: - If
        after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation string of the
        redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited from the original
        method. - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
        visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be inherited.
        - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be modified
        as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the version of the
        including interface plus the root path if specified. Example of a simple
        mixin: package google.acl.v1; service AccessControl { // Get the
        underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option
        (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl"; } } package
        google.storage.v2; service Storage { // rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest)
        returns (Acl); // Get a data record. rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns
        (Data) { option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}"; } } Example
        of a mixin configuration: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
        mixins: - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl The mixin construct implies
        that all methods in `AccessControl` are also declared with same name and
        request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator or
        annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method
        after inheriting documentation and annotations as follows: service
        Storage { // Get the underlying ACL object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest)
        returns (Acl) { option (google.api.http).get =
        "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl"; } ... } Note how the version in the path
        pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`. If the `root` field in the mixin is
        specified, it should be a relative path under which inherited HTTP paths
        are placed. Example: apis: - name: google.storage.v2.Storage mixins: -
        name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl root: acls This implies the following
        inherited HTTP annotation: service Storage { // Get the underlying ACL
        object. rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) { option
        (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl"; } ... }

      description: >-
        gRPC Transcoding gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a
        gRPC method and one or more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to
        build a single API service that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs.
        Many systems, including [Google
        APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), [Cloud
        Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC
        Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and
        [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature
        and use it for large scale production services. `HttpRule` defines the
        schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies how different
        portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL path, URL
        query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC
        response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is
        typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC
        method. Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method.
        The path template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request
        message, as long as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive
        (non-message) type. The path template controls how fields of the request
        message are mapped to the URL path. Example: service Messaging { rpc
        GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
        (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/{name=messages/*}" }; } } message
        GetMessageRequest { string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path. } message
        Message { string text = 1; // The resource content. } This enables an
        HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below: - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456` -
        gRPC: `GetMessage(name: "messages/123456")` Any fields in the request
        message which are not bound by the path template automatically become
        HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example:
        service Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message)
        { option (google.api.http) = { get:"/v1/messages/{message_id}" }; } }
        message GetMessageRequest { message SubMessage { string subfield = 1; }
        string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path. int64 revision = 2; //
        Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`. SubMessage sub = 3; // Mapped
        to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`. } This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC
        mapping as below: - HTTP: `GET
        /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` - gRPC:
        `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield:
        "foo"))` Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must
        have a primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated
        message type. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be
        repeated in the URL as `...?param=A&param=B`. In the case of a message
        type, each field of the message is mapped to a separate parameter, such
        as `...?foo.a=A&foo.b=B&foo.c=C`. For HTTP methods that allow a request
        body, the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update
        method on the message resource collection: service Messaging { rpc
        UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
        (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body: "message"
        }; } } message UpdateMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; // mapped
        to the URL Message message = 2; // mapped to the body } The following
        HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the
        JSON in the request body is determined by protos JSON encoding: - HTTP:
        `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` - gRPC:
        `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })` The
        special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that every
        field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the request
        body. This enables the following alternative definition of the update
        method: service Messaging { rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message)
        { option (google.api.http) = { patch: "/v1/messages/{message_id}" body:
        "*" }; } } message Message { string message_id = 1; string text = 2; }
        The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled: - HTTP: `PATCH
        /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` - gRPC:
        `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")` Note that when using
        `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as
        all fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option
        more rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage
        of `*` is in custom methods which don't use the URL at all for
        transferring data. It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for
        one RPC by using the `additional_bindings` option. Example: service
        Messaging { rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) { option
        (google.api.http) = { get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
        additional_bindings { get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}" }
        }; } } message GetMessageRequest { string message_id = 1; string user_id
        = 2; } This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC
        mappings: - HTTP: `GET /v1/messages/123456` - gRPC:
        `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")` - HTTP: `GET
        /v1/users/me/messages/123456` - gRPC: `GetMessage(user_id: "me"
        message_id: "123456")` Rules for HTTP mapping 1. Leaf request fields
        (recursive expansion nested messages in the request message) are
        classified into three categories: - Fields referred by the path
        template. They are passed via the URL path. - Fields referred by the
        HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP request body. - All other
        fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the parameter name
        is the field path in the request message. A repeated field can be
        represented as multiple query parameters under the same name. 2. If
        HttpRule.body is "*", there is no URL query parameter, all fields are
        passed via URL path and HTTP request body. 3. If HttpRule.body is
        omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all fields are passed via URL
        path and URL query parameters. Path template syntax Template = "/"
        Segments [ Verb ] ; Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ; Segment = "*" |
        "**" | LITERAL | Variable ; Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ]
        "}" ; FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ; Verb = ":" LITERAL ; The syntax
        `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or
        more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path
        except the `Verb`. The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as
        specified by its template. A variable template must not contain other
        variables. If a variable matches a single path segment, its template may
        be omitted, e.g. `{var}` is equivalent to `{var=*}`. The syntax
        `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL`
        contains any reserved character, such characters should be
        percent-encoded before the matching. If a variable contains exactly one
        path segment, such as `"{var}"` or `"{var=*}"`, when such a variable is
        expanded into a URL path on the client side, all characters except
        `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse
        decoding. Such variables show up in the [Discovery
        Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
        `{var}`. If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as
        `"{var=foo/*}"` or `"{var=**}"`, when such a variable is expanded into a
        URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]`
        are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except
        "%2F" and "%2f" are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the
        [Discovery
        Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as
        `{+var}`. Using gRPC API Service Configuration gRPC API Service
        Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for
        configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service
        config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service`
        proto message. As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can
        configure gRPC transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do
        this by specifying a `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST
        endpoint, achieving the same effect as the proto annotation. This can be
        particularly useful if you have a proto that is reused in multiple
        services. Note that any transcoding specified in the service config will
        override any matching transcoding configuration in the proto. The
        following example selects a gRPC method and applies an `HttpRule` to it:
        http: rules: - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage get:
        /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield} Special notes When gRPC
        Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to
        JSON conversion must follow the [proto3
        specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).
        While the single segment variable follows the semantics of [RFC
        6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
        Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570
        Section 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved
        Expansion does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which
        would lead to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a
        custom encoding for multi segment variables. The path variables **must
        not** refer to any repeated or mapped field, because client libraries
        are not capable of handling such variable expansion. The path variables
        **must not** capture the leading "/" character. The reason is that the
        most common use case "{var}" does not capture the leading "/" character.
        For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.
        Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters,
        because no client library can support such complicated mapping. If an
        API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map
        the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC
        Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

        Quota configuration helps to achieve fairness and budgeting in service
        usage. The metric based quota configuration works this way: - The
        service configuration defines a set of metrics. - For API calls, the
        quota.metric_rules maps methods to metrics with corresponding costs. -
        The quota.limits defines limits on the metrics, which will be used for
        quota checks at runtime. An example quota configuration in yaml format:
        quota: limits: - name: apiWriteQpsPerProject metric:
        library.googleapis.com/write_calls unit: "1/min/{project}" # rate limit
        for consumer projects values: STANDARD: 10000 (The metric rules bind all
        methods to the read_calls metric, except for the UpdateBook and
        DeleteBook methods. These two methods are mapped to the write_calls

        OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For
        example, there are scopes defined for "Read-only access to Google
        Calendar" and "Access to Cloud Platform". Users can consent to a scope
        for an application, giving it permission to access that data on their
        behalf. OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained; a
        user will need to see and understand the text description of what your
        scope means. In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an
        entire family of products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should
        probably be sharing the OAuth scope across all of those APIs. When you
        need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product
        management about how developers will use them in practice. Please note
        that even though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a request to
        be accepted and passed to the backend, a request can still fail due to
        the backend requiring additional scopes or permissions.

            easily displayed (so a value of `0.02kBy` _might_ be displayed as
            `20By`, and a value of `3523kBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`).

            If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of
            CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE`
            metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just
            `s`). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written
            as `12005`. Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record
            data in a more granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE`
            metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005`
            (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which
            is `12005/1024`). The supported units are a subset of [The Unified

            * `Pi` pebi (2^50) **Grammar** The grammar also includes these
            connectors: * `/` division or ratio (as an infix operator). For
            examples, `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost
            never have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed
            at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). * `.`
            multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples,
            `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`. The grammar for a unit is as follows:
            Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;
            Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation |
            "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: * `Annotation` is just a
            comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation is used alone,
            then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples, `{request}/s ==
            1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of
            non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing `{` or `}`. *
            `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless
            unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1,
            such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units
            are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented
            as `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5
            new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would
            be represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a
            metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300 page views per day"). * `%`
            represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving
            a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of
            0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%`
            indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1,
            that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a
            metric value `0.03` means "3 percent").

              Early Access features are limited to a closed group of testers. To
              use these features, you must sign up in advance and sign a Trusted
              Tester agreement (which includes confidentiality provisions).
              These features may be unstable, changed in backward-incompatible
              ways, and are not guaranteed to be released.

              Alpha is a limited availability test for releases before they are
              cleared for widespread use. By Alpha, all significant design
              issues are resolved and we are in the process of verifying
              functionality. Alpha customers need to apply for access, agree to
              applicable terms, and have their projects allowlisted. Alpha
              releases don't have to be feature complete, no SLAs are provided,
              and there are no technical support obligations, but they will be
              far enough along that customers can actually use them in test
              environments or for limited-use tests -- just like they would in
              normal production cases.
            - >-
              Beta is the point at which we are ready to open a release for any
              customer to use. There are no SLA or technical support obligations
              in a Beta release. Products will be complete from a feature
              perspective, but may have some open outstanding issues. Beta
              releases are suitable for limited production use cases.
            - >-
              GA features are open to all developers and are considered stable
              and fully qualified for production use.
