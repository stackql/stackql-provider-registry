      id: GoogleIamV1Policy
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
