The higher the boost, the higher the chance of false positive recognition as well. Negative boost values would correspond to anti-biasing. Anti-biasing is not enabled, so negative boost will simply be ignored. Though `boost` can accept a wide range of positive values, most use cases are best served with values between 0 and 20. We recommend using a binary search approach to finding the optimal value for your use case.

This can also be used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content). List items can also be set to classes for groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For example, rather than providing phrase hints for every month of the year, using the $MONTH class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months.

            - Not specified.
            - Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
            - '`FLAC` (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding because it is lossless--therefore recognition is not compromised--and requires only about half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream encoding supports 16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in `STREAMINFO` are supported.'
            - 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU/mu-law.
            - Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 8000.
            - Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000.
            - Opus encoded audio frames in Ogg container ([OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus)). `sample_rate_hertz` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000.
            - Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding supported by Cloud Speech API has a header byte in each block, as in MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC 5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must be 16000.
            - Opus encoded audio frames in WebM container ([OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus)). `sample_rate_hertz` must be one of 8000, 12000, 16000, 24000, or 48000.

    Phrase:
      description: 'A phrases containing words and phrase "hints" so that the speech recognition is more likely to recognize them. This can be used to improve the accuracy for specific words and phrases, for example, if specific commands are typically spoken by the user. This can also be used to add additional words to the vocabulary of the recognizer. See [usage limits](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/quotas#content). List items can also include pre-built or custom classes containing groups of words that represent common concepts that occur in natural language. For example, rather than providing a phrase hint for every month of the year (e.g. "i was born in january", "i was born in febuary", ...), use the pre-built `$MONTH` class improves the likelihood of correctly transcribing audio that includes months (e.g. "i was born in $month"). To refer to pre-built classes, use the class'' symbol prepended with `$` e.g. `$MONTH`. To refer to custom classes that were defined inline in the request, set the class''s `custom_class_id` to a string unique to all class resources and inline classes. Then use the class'' id wrapped in $`{...}` e.g. "${my-months}". To refer to custom classes resources, use the class'' id wrapped in `${}` (e.g. `${my-months}`). Speech-to-Text supports three locations: `global`, `us` (US North America), and `eu` (Europe). If you are calling the `speech.googleapis.com` endpoint, use the `global` location. To specify a region, use a [regional endpoint](/speech-to-text/docs/endpoints) with matching `us` or `eu` location value.'

Positive value will increase the probability that a specific phrase will be recognized over other similar sounding phrases. The higher the boost, the higher the chance of false positive recognition as well. Negative boost will simply be ignored. Though `boost` can accept a wide range of positive values, most use cases are best served with values between 0 and 20. We recommend using a binary search approach to finding the optimal value for your use case. Speech recognition will skip PhraseSets with a boost value of 0.

To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.'
