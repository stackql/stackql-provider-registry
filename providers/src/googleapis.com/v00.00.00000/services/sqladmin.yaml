            and no database is specified, all databases are exported, except for
            the `mysql` system database. If `fileType` is `CSV`, you can specify
            one database, either by using this property or by using the
            `csvExportOptions.selectQuery` property, which takes precedence over
            this property. `PostgreSQL instances:` If you don't specify a
            database by name, all user databases in the instance are exported.
            This excludes system databases and Cloud SQL databases used to
            manage internal operations. Exporting all user databases is only
            available for directory-formatted parallel export. If `fileType` is
            `CSV`, this database must match the one specified in the
            `csvExportOptions.selectQuery` property. `SQL Server instances:` You
            must specify one database to be exported, and the `fileType` must be
            `BAK`.
