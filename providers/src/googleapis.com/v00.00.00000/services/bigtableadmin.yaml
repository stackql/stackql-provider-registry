        rowKeySchema:

            The row key schema for this table. The schema is used to decode the
            raw row key bytes into a structured format. The order of field
            declarations in this schema is important, as it reflects how the raw
            row key bytes are structured. Currently, this only affects how the
            key is read via a GoogleSQL query from the ExecuteQuery API. For a
            SQL query, the _key column is still read as raw bytes. But queries
            can reference the key fields by name, which will be decoded from
            _key using provided type and encoding. Queries that reference key
            fields will fail if they encounter an invalid row key. For example,
            if _key = "some_id#2024-04-30#\x00\x13\x00\xf3" with the following
            schema: { fields { field_name: "id" type { string { encoding:
            utf8_bytes {} } } } fields { field_name: "date" type { string {
            encoding: utf8_bytes {} } } } fields { field_name: "product_code"
            type { int64 { encoding: big_endian_bytes {} } } } encoding {
            delimited_bytes { delimiter: "#" } } } The decoded key parts would
            be: id = "some_id", date = "2024-04-30", product_code = 1245427 The
            query "SELECT _key, product_code FROM table" will return two
            columns: /------------------------------------------------------\ |
            _key | product_code | |
            --------------------------------------|--------------| |
            "some_id#2024-04-30#\x00\x13\x00\xf3" | 1245427 |
            \------------------------------------------------------/ The schema
            has the following invariants: (1) The decoded field values are
            order-preserved. For read, the field values will be decoded in
            sorted mode from the raw bytes. (2) Every field in the schema must
            specify a non-empty name. (3) Every field must specify a type with
            an associated encoding. The type is limited to scalar types only:
            Array, Map, Aggregate, and Struct are not allowed. (4) The field
            names must not collide with existing column family names and
            reserved keywords "_key" and "_timestamp". The following update
            operations are allowed for row_key_schema: - Update from an empty
            schema to a new schema. - Remove the existing schema. This operation
            requires setting the `ignore_warnings` flag to `true`, since it
            might be a backward incompatible change. Without the flag, the
            update request will fail with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error. Any other
            row key schema update operation (e.g. update existing schema columns
            names or types) is currently unsupported.

    GoogleBigtableAdminV2TypeStructEncodingOrderedCodeBytes:
      description: >-
        Fields are encoded independently, then escaped and delimited by appling
        the following rules in order: - While the last remaining field is `ASC`
        or `UNSPECIFIED`, and encodes to the empty string "", remove it. - In
        each remaining field, replace all null bytes `0x00` with the fixed byte
        pair `{0x00, 0xFF}`. - If any remaining field encodes to the empty
        string "", replace it with the fixed byte pair `{0x00, 0x00}`. - Append
        the fixed byte pair `{0x00, 0x01}` to each remaining field, except for
        the last remaining field if it is `ASC`. - Bitwise negate all `DESC`
        fields. - Concatenate the results, or emit the fixed byte pair `{0x00,
        0x00}` if there are no remaining fields to concatenate. Examples: ``` -
        STRUCT() -> "\00\00" - STRUCT("") -> "\00\00" - STRUCT("", "") ->
        "\00\00" - STRUCT("", "B") -> "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "B" - STRUCT("A",
        "") -> "A" - STRUCT("", "B", "") -> "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "B" -
        STRUCT("A", "", "C") -> "A" + "\00\01" + "\00\00" + "\00\01" + "C" ```
        Examples for struct with `DESC` fields: ``` - STRUCT("" DESC) ->
        "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("" DESC, "") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE"
        - STRUCT("" DESC, "", "") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("" DESC,
        "A") -> "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" + "A" - STRUCT("A", "" DESC, "") -> "A"
        + "\00\01" + "\xFF\xFF" + "\xFF\xFE" - STRUCT("", "A" DESC) ->
        "\x00\x00" + "\x00\x01" + "\xBE" + "\xFF\xFE" ``` Since null bytes are
        always escaped, this encoding can cause size blowup for encodings like
        `Int64.BigEndianBytes` that are likely to produce many such bytes.
        Sorted mode: - Fields are encoded in sorted mode. - All values supported
        by the field encodings are allowed. - Fields with unset or `UNSPECIFIED`
        order are treated as `ASC`. - Element-wise order is preserved: `A < B`
        if `A[0] < B[0]`, or if `A[0] == B[0] && A[1] < B[1]`, etc. Strict
        prefixes sort first. Distinct mode: - Fields are encoded in distinct
        mode. - All values supported by the field encodings are allowed.

            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever

        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the

    Type:
      description: >-
        `Type` represents the type of data that is written to, read from, or
        stored in Bigtable. It is heavily based on the GoogleSQL standard to
        help maintain familiarity and consistency across products and features.
        For compatibility with Bigtable's existing untyped APIs, each `Type`
        includes an `Encoding` which describes how to convert to or from the
        underlying data. Each encoding can operate in one of two modes: -
        Sorted: In this mode, Bigtable guarantees that `Encode(X) <= Encode(Y)`
        if and only if `X <= Y`. This is useful anywhere sort order is
        important, for example when encoding keys. - Distinct: In this mode,
        Bigtable guarantees that if `X != Y` then `Encode(X) != Encode(Y)`.
        However, the converse is not guaranteed. For example, both `{'foo': '1',
        'bar': '2'}` and `{'bar': '2', 'foo': '1'}` are valid encodings of the
        same JSON value. The API clearly documents which mode is used wherever
        an encoding can be configured. Each encoding also documents which values
        are supported in which modes. For example, when encoding INT64 as a
        numeric STRING, negative numbers cannot be encoded in sorted mode. This
        is because `INT64(1) > INT64(-1)`, but `STRING("-00001") >
        STRING("00001")`.

        Partially updates a cluster within a project. This method is the
        preferred way to update a Cluster. To enable and update autoscaling, set
        cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config. When autoscaling is enabled,
        serve_nodes is treated as an OUTPUT_ONLY field, meaning that updates to
        it are ignored. Note that an update cannot simultaneously set
        serve_nodes to non-zero and cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config to
        non-empty, and also specify both in the update_mask. To disable
        autoscaling, clear cluster_config.cluster_autoscaling_config, and
        explicitly set a serve_node count via the update_mask.
