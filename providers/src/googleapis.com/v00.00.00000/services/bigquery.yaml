          description: >-
            Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source
            decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the
            scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In
            the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it
            is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the
            scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of
            the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type
            supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if
            a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error
            will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is
            ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If (precision,scale) is: * (38,9) ->
            NUMERIC; * (39,9) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer
            digits); * (38,10) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional
            digits); * (76,38) -> BIGNUMERIC; * (77,38) -> BIGNUMERIC (error if
            value exceeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate
            types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example,
            ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]
            and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to
            ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"] for the other file
            formats.

        writeDisposition:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table
            already exists. The following values are supported: *
            WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the
            data, removes the constraints and uses the schema from the load job.
            * WRITE_TRUNCATE_DATA: If the table already exists, BigQuery
            overwrites the data, but keeps the constraints and schema of the
            existing table. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists,
            BigQuery appends the data to the table. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table
            already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in
            the job result. The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is
            atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job
            successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one
            atomic update upon job completion.

            - NAME
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Controls the strategy used to match loaded columns to the
            schema. If not set, a sensible default is chosen based on how the
            schema is provided. If autodetect is used, then columns are matched
            by name. Otherwise, columns are matched by position. This is done to

        schemaUpdateOptions:
          items:
            type: string
          description: >-
            Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side
            effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or supplied in
            the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in three
            cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition
            is WRITE_TRUNCATE_DATA; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and
            the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by
            partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always
            overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are
            specified: * ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to
            the schema. * ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required
            field in the original schema to nullable.

            Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties.
            If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If
            any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an
            invalid error is returned in the job result.

        createSession:
          description: >-
            Optional. If this property is true, the job creates a new session
            using a randomly generated session_id. To continue using a created
            session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session
            identifier as a `ConnectionProperty` value. The session identifier
            is returned as part of the `SessionInfo` message within the query
            statistics. The new session's location will be set to
            `Job.JobReference.location` if it is present, otherwise it's set to
            the default location based on existing routing logic.

            $ref: '#/components/schemas/ConnectionProperty'
          description: >-
            Optional. Connection properties which can modify the load job
            behavior. Currently, only the 'session_id' connection property is
            supported, and is used to resolve _SESSION appearing as the dataset
            id.
        autodetect:
          description: >-
            Optional. Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and
            schema for CSV and JSON sources.
          type: boolean
        nullMarker:
          description: >-
            Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV
            file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as
            a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty
            string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws
            an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for
            STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets
            the empty string as an empty value.
          type: string
        nullMarkers:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. A list of strings represented as SQL NULL value in a CSV
            file. null_marker and null_markers can't be set at the same time. If
            null_marker is set, null_markers has to be not set. If null_markers
            is set, null_marker has to be not set. If both null_marker and
            null_markers are set at the same time, a user error would be thrown.
            Any strings listed in null_markers, including empty string would be
            interpreted as SQL NULL. This applies to all column types.
        timeZone:
          description: >-
            Optional. Default time zone that will apply when parsing timestamp
            values that have no specific time zone.
          type: string
        createDisposition:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables.
            The following values are supported: * CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table
            does not exist, BigQuery creates the table. * CREATE_NEVER: The
            table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is
            returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED.
            Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update
            upon job completion.
        datetimeFormat:
          description: Optional. Date format used for parsing DATETIME values.
          type: string
        dateFormat:
          type: string
          description: Optional. Date format used for parsing DATE values.
        skipLeadingRows:
          description: >-
            Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery
            will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This
            property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should
            be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: *
            skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in
            the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data.
            Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. *
            skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no
            headers and data should be read starting from the first row. *
            skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to
            detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just
            skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the
            detected schema.

            when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this
            value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default
            value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only
            supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.

            Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV
            file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then

            to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters,
            you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To
            include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede
            it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you

            separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in
            ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For
            files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range
            1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8
            characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will
            have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining
            bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports
            the escape sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The

          description: >-
            Optional. The schema for the destination table. The schema can be
            omitted if the destination table already exists, or if you're
            loading data from Google Cloud Datastore.
        encoding:
          description: >-
            Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values
            are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.
            The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw,
            binary data has been split using the values of the `quote` and
            `fieldDelimiter` properties. If you don't specify an encoding, or if
            you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded,
            BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data
            loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you
            expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the
            `--encoding` flag. If BigQuery can't convert a character other than
            the ASCII `0` character, BigQuery converts the character to the
            standard Unicode replacement character: �.

            immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example,
            consider files following this data layout:
            gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avro
            gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avro
            When hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS
            detection, the common prefix can be either of
            gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/. CUSTOM
            detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately
            after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of *
            gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER} *
            gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER}
            * gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING}
            would all be valid source URI prefixes.
          type: string
        mode:
          description: >-
            Optional. When set, what mode of hive partitioning to use when
            reading data. The following modes are supported: * AUTO:
            automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s). * STRINGS:
            automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings. *
            CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix.
            Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive
            partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error.

        - If the original script (or procedure definition) contains TAB
        characters, a tab "snaps" the indentation forward to the nearest
        multiple of 8 characters, plus 1. For example, a TAB on column 1, 2, 3,

            tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.
        requestId:
          description: >-
            Optional. A unique user provided identifier to ensure idempotent
            behavior for queries. Note that this is different from the job_id.
            It has the following properties: 1. It is case-sensitive, limited to
            up to 36 ASCII characters. A UUID is recommended. 2. Read only
            queries can ignore this token since they are nullipotent by
            definition. 3. For the purposes of idempotency ensured by the
            request_id, a request is considered duplicate of another only if
            they have the same request_id and are actually duplicates. When
            determining whether a request is a duplicate of another request, all
            parameters in the request that may affect the result are considered.
            For example, query, connection_properties, query_parameters,
            use_legacy_sql are parameters that affect the result and are
            considered when determining whether a request is a duplicate, but
            properties like timeout_ms don't affect the result and are thus not
            considered. Dry run query requests are never considered duplicate of
            another request. 4. When a duplicate mutating query request is
            detected, it returns: a. the results of the mutation if it completes
            successfully within the timeout. b. the running operation if it is
            still in progress at the end of the timeout. 5. Its lifetime is
            limited to 15 minutes. In other words, if two requests are sent with
            the same request_id, but more than 15 minutes apart, idempotency is
            not guaranteed.

            Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table
            already exists. The following values are supported: *
            WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the
            data, removes the constraints, and uses the schema from the query
            result. * WRITE_TRUNCATE_DATA: If the table already exists, BigQuery
            overwrites the data, but keeps the constraints and schema of the
            existing table. * WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists,
            BigQuery appends the data to the table. * WRITE_EMPTY: If the table
            already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in
            the job result. The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is
            atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job

        nullMarker:

            a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the

            throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types

          type: string
          format: int64
          description: >-
            Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery
            will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This
            property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should
            be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: *
            skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in
            the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data.
            Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. *
            skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no
            headers and data should be read starting from the first row. *
            skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to
            detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just
            skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the
            detected schema.
        fieldDelimiter:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The
            separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in
            ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For
            files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range
            1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8
            characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will
            have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining
            bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports
            the escape sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The
            default value is comma (",", U+002C).
        allowQuotedNewlines:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections
            that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is
            false.
        encoding:
          description: >-
            Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values
            are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.
            The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw,
            binary data has been split using the values of the quote and
            fieldDelimiter properties.
          type: string
        sourceColumnMatch:
          description: >-
            Optional. Controls the strategy used to match loaded columns to the
            schema. If not set, a sensible default is chosen based on how the
            schema is provided. If autodetect is used, then columns are matched
            by name. Otherwise, columns are matched by position. This is done to
            keep the behavior backward-compatible. Acceptable values are:
            POSITION - matches by position. This assumes that the columns are
            ordered the same way as the schema. NAME - matches by name. This
            reads the header row as column names and reorders columns to match
            the field names in the schema.
          type: string
        quote:
          default: '"'
          type: string
          pattern: .?
          description: >-
            Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV
            file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then
            uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its
            raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ("). If your
            data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an
            empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you
            must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include
            the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with
            an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to
            escape the default character ' " ', use ' "" '.
        nullMarkers:
          description: >-
            Optional. A list of strings represented as SQL NULL value in a CSV
            file. null_marker and null_markers can't be set at the same time. If
            null_marker is set, null_markers has to be not set. If null_markers
            is set, null_marker has to be not set. If both null_marker and
            null_markers are set at the same time, a user error would be thrown.
            Any strings listed in null_markers, including empty string would be
            interpreted as SQL NULL. This applies to all column types.

            columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing
            columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad
            records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default
            value is false.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",

        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -

            the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type
            supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if
            a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error
            will be thrown. Example: Suppose the value of this field is

            value exceeds supported range). This field cannot contain duplicate
            types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example,
            ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]
            and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC. Defaults to

        `@@dataset_project_id` achieves the same behavior. For more information

        **time_zone**: represents the default timezone used to run the query. *
        **session_id**: associates the query with a given session. *
        **query_label**: associates the query with a given job label. If set,

        the format in which a you can specify a query label, see labels in the

        * **service_account**: indicates the service account to use to run a

        access Google Cloud resources. Service account access is bounded by the
        IAM permissions that you have granted to the service account. Additional

            When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following: *
            skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in
            the first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data.
            Otherwise data is read starting from the second row. *
            skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no
            headers and data should be read starting from the first row. *
            skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to
            detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just
            skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the
            detected schema.

            the function created with the following statement: `CREATE FUNCTION
            JoinLines(x string, y string) as (concat(x, "\n", y))` The
            definition_body is `concat(x, "\n", y)` (\n is not replaced with
