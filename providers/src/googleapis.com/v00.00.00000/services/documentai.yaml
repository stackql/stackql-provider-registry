        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design

        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...
        public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha =
        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return

        protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color
        toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed();
        float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float)
        color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder
        = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green /
        denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha();
        if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder()
        .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return
        resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static
        UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red];
        float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue];
        FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if
        (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return
        [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static
        Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if
        (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return
        nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red];

        greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue ||

        internationalization-ready address widget such as

            default). Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
        locality:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.
            Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world
            where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this
            structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
        organization:
          description: Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          type: string
        revision:
          description: >-
            The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0,
            which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward
            compatible with old revisions.
          type: integer
          format: int32
        sortingCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not
            used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string
            like "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (e.g. "CEDEX 7"), or
            just a number alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica),
            "delivery area indicator" (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (e.g.
            Côte d'Ivoire).
        addressLines:
          description: >-
            Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an
            address. Because values in address_lines do not have type
            information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single
            field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is
            clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the
            country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g.
            Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for
            large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large).
            This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based
            on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of
            an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information
            placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an
            address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic
            reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it
            was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing
            a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the
            recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as
            opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities
            or administrative areas).

            This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value
            is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and
            https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html
            for details. Example: "CH" for Switzerland.
        administrativeArea:
          description: >-
            Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for
            postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a
            state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for
            Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g.
            "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an
            administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this
            should be left unpopulated.

      description: >-
        Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can
        represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset
        is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a
        particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is
        unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When
        neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day
        in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
        If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a
        specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to
        represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and
        either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using
        `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also
        would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done in another
        field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make
        sure to document and validate your application's limitations.

              functionality. Alpha customers need to apply for access, agree to
              applicable terms, and have their projects allowlisted. Alpha
              releases don't have to be feature complete, no SLAs are provided,
              and there are no technical support obligations, but they will be
              far enough along that customers can actually use them in test
              environments or for limited-use tests -- just like they would in
              normal production cases.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
