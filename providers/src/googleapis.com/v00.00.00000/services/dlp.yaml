        Custom information type based on a dictionary of words or phrases. This

        a list of employee IDs or job titles. Dictionary words are
        case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the
        unicode [Basic Multilingual
        Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane)
        will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the
        dictionary phrase "Sam Johnson" will match all three phrases "sam
        johnson", "Sam, Johnson", and "Sam (Johnson)". Additionally, the
        characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the
        adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to
        non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary
        word "jen" will match the first three letters of the text "jen123" but
        will return no matches for "jennifer". Dictionary words containing a
        large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in
        unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace.

        Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving
        Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in

        reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The

            A context may be used for higher security and maintaining
            referential integrity such that the same identifier in two different
            contexts will be given a distinct surrogate. The context is appended
            to plaintext value being encrypted. On decryption the provided
            context is validated against the value used during encryption. If a
            context was provided during encryption, same context must be
            provided during decryption as well. If the context is not set,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. If the context is set
            but: 1. there is no record present when transforming a given value
            or 2. the field is not present when transforming a given value,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. Note that case (1) is
            expected when an `InfoTypeTransformation` is applied to both
            structured and unstructured `ContentItem`s.

        Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular

        the bucket to include. Included files are those that match at least one
        item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`.
        Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be
        included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything
        in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For
        example, given the input `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex:
        ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}`: *
        `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included *

        `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be
        included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If
        `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this
        is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [".*"]`). Some other common use
        cases: * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}` will
        include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name:

            Config for storing transformation details. This field specifies the

            transformation performed during a de-identification process. The
            metadata is stored separately from the de-identified content itself
            and provides a granular record of both successful transformations
            and any failures that occurred. Enabling this configuration is
            essential for users who need to access comprehensive information
            about the status, outcome, and specifics of each transformation. The
            details are captured in the TransformationDetails message for each
            operation. Key use cases: * **Auditing and compliance** * Provides a
            verifiable audit trail of de-identification activities, which is
            crucial for meeting regulatory requirements and internal data
            governance policies. * Logs what data was transformed, what
            transformations were applied, when they occurred, and their success
            status. This helps demonstrate accountability and due diligence in
            protecting sensitive data. * **Troubleshooting and debugging** *
            Offers detailed error messages and context if a transformation
            fails. This information is useful for diagnosing and resolving
            issues in the de-identification pipeline. * Helps pinpoint the exact
            location and nature of failures, speeding up the debugging process.
            * **Process verification and quality assurance** * Allows users to
            confirm that de-identification rules and transformations were
            applied correctly and consistently across the dataset as intended. *
            Helps in verifying the effectiveness of the chosen de-identification
            strategies. * **Data lineage and impact analysis** * Creates a
            record of how data elements were modified, contributing to data
            lineage. This is useful for understanding the provenance of
            de-identified data. * Aids in assessing the potential impact of
            de-identification choices on downstream analytical processes or data
            usability. * **Reporting and operational insights** * You can
            analyze the metadata stored in a queryable BigQuery table to
            generate reports on transformation success rates, common error
            types, processing volumes (e.g., transformedBytes), and the types of
            transformations applied. * These insights can inform optimization of
            de-identification configurations and resource planning. To take
            advantage of these benefits, set this configuration. The stored
            details include a description of the transformation, success or
            error codes, error messages, the number of bytes transformed, the
            location of the transformed content, and identifiers for the job and
            source data.
