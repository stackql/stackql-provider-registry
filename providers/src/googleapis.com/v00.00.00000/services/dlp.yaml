        Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular
        expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in

        item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`.
        Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be
        included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything
        in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For
        example, given the input `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex:
        ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}`: *
        `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included *

        `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be

        `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this
        is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [".*"]`). Some other common use
        cases: * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}` will

        Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane)
        will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the
        dictionary phrase "Sam Johnson" will match all three phrases "sam
        johnson", "Sam, Johnson", and "Sam (Johnson)". Additionally, the
        characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the
        adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to
        non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary
        word "jen" will match the first three letters of the text "jen123" but
        will return no matches for "jennifer". Dictionary words containing a
        large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in

            The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation
            will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of
            the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format:
            info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if
            the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the
            surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom infoType
            [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype).
            This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free
            text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this
            infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise,
            inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an
            actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name
            carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to
            select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection
            is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly
            improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is
            entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code
            point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

        maskingCharacter:
          description: >-
            Character to use to mask the sensitive values—for example, `*` for
            an alphabetic string such as a name, or `0` for a numeric string
            such as ZIP code or credit card number. This string must have a
            length of 1. If not supplied, this value defaults to `*` for
            strings, and `0` for digits.

        numberToMask:
          type: integer

          description: >-
            Number of characters to mask. If not set, all matching chars will be
            masked. Skipped characters do not count towards this tally. If
            `number_to_mask` is negative, this denotes inverse masking. Cloud
            DLP masks all but a number of characters. For example, suppose you
            have the following values: - `masking_character` is `*` -
            `number_to_mask` is `-4` - `reverse_order` is `false` -
            `CharsToIgnore` includes `-` - Input string is `1234-5678-9012-3456`
            The resulting de-identified string is `****-****-****-3456`. Cloud
            DLP masks all but the last four characters. If `reverse_order` is
            `true`, all but the first four characters are masked as
            `1234-****-****-****`.
        reverseOrder:
          description: >-
            Mask characters in reverse order. For example, if
            `masking_character` is `0`, `number_to_mask` is `14`, and
            `reverse_order` is `false`, then the input string
            `1234-5678-9012-3456` is masked as `00000000000000-3456`. If
            `masking_character` is `*`, `number_to_mask` is `3`, and
            `reverse_order` is `true`, then the string `12345` is masked as
            `12***`.
          type: boolean
        charactersToIgnore:
          type: array
          description: >-
            When masking a string, items in this list will be skipped when
            replacing characters. For example, if the input string is
            `555-555-5555` and you instruct Cloud DLP to skip `-` and mask 5
            characters with `*`, Cloud DLP returns `***-**5-5555`.

            A context may be used for higher security and maintaining
            referential integrity such that the same identifier in two different

            to plaintext value being encrypted. On decryption the provided
            context is validated against the value used during encryption. If a
            context was provided during encryption, same context must be
            provided during decryption as well. If the context is not set,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. If the context is set
            but: 1. there is no record present when transforming a given value
            or 2. the field is not present when transforming a given value,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. Note that case (1) is

        surrogateInfoType:
          description: >-
            The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation
            will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of
            the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type
            name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate} For example, if the
            name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate
            is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This
            facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
            Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is
            being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used
            to denote the location of the token and are necessary for
            re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work
            properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally
            anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a
            surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be
            unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore,
            choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what
            your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high
            chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more
            unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
            For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII
            keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like
            so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.
