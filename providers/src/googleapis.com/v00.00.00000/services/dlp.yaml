        context:

            A context may be used for higher security and maintaining
            referential integrity such that the same identifier in two different
            contexts will be given a distinct surrogate. The context is appended
            to plaintext value being encrypted. On decryption the provided
            context is validated against the value used during encryption. If a
            context was provided during encryption, same context must be
            provided during decryption as well. If the context is not set,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. If the context is set
            but: 1. there is no record present when transforming a given value
            or 2. the field is not present when transforming a given value,
            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. Note that case (1) is

        surrogateInfoType:
          description: >-
            The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation
            will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of
            the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type
            name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate} For example, if the
            name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate
            is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This
            facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
            Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is
            being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used
            to denote the location of the token and are necessary for
            re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work
            properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally
            anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a
            surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be
            unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore,
            choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what
            your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high
            chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more
            unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
            For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII
            keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like
            so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

        This message is provided as a convenience to the user for simple
        bucketing strategies. The transformed value will be a hyphenated string
        of {lower_bound}-{upper_bound}. For example, if lower_bound = 10 and
        upper_bound = 20, all values that are within this bucket will be
        replaced with "10-20". This can be used on data of type: double, long.
        If the bound Value type differs from the type of data being transformed,
        we will first attempt converting the type of the data to be transformed
        to match the type of the bound before comparing. See

        Message representing a set of files in a Cloud Storage bucket. Regular
        expressions are used to allow fine-grained control over which files in
        the bucket to include. Included files are those that match at least one
        item in `include_regex` and do not match any items in `exclude_regex`.
        Note that a file that matches items from both lists will _not_ be
        included. For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything
        in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For
        example, given the input `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex:
        ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}`: *
        `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included *
        `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*`
        matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will
        _not_ be included (the full path doesn't match any items in
        `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be
        included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If
        `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this
        is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [".*"]`). Some other common use
        cases: * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\.pdf"]}` will
        include all files in `mybucket` except for .pdf files * `{bucket_name:

            `number_to_mask` is negative, this denotes inverse masking. Cloud
            DLP masks all but a number of characters. For example, suppose you

            `number_to_mask` is `-4` - `reverse_order` is `false` -

            the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format:
            info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if
            the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the
            surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom infoType
            [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype).
            This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free
            text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this
            infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise,
            inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an
            actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name
            carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to
            select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection
            is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly
            improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is
            entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code
            point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

        Custom information type based on a dictionary of words or phrases. This
        can be used to match sensitive information specific to the data, such as
        a list of employee IDs or job titles. Dictionary words are
        case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the
        unicode [Basic Multilingual
        Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane)
        will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the
        dictionary phrase "Sam Johnson" will match all three phrases "sam
        johnson", "Sam, Johnson", and "Sam (Johnson)". Additionally, the
        characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the
        adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to
        non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary
        word "jen" will match the first three letters of the text "jen123" but
        will return no matches for "jennifer". Dictionary words containing a
        large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in
        unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace.
        The [limits](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/limits)
        page contains details about the size limits of dictionaries. For
        dictionaries that do not fit within these constraints, consider using
        `LargeCustomDictionaryConfig` in the `StoredInfoType` API.
