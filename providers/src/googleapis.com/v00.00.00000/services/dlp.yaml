        Custom information type based on a dictionary of words or phrases. This
        can be used to match sensitive information specific to the data, such as
        a list of employee IDs or job titles. Dictionary words are
        case-insensitive and all characters other than letters and digits in the
        unicode [Basic Multilingual
        Plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane)
        will be replaced with whitespace when scanning for matches, so the
        dictionary phrase "Sam Johnson" will match all three phrases "sam
        johnson", "Sam, Johnson", and "Sam (Johnson)". Additionally, the
        characters surrounding any match must be of a different type than the
        adjacent characters within the word, so letters must be next to
        non-letters and digits next to non-digits. For example, the dictionary
        word "jen" will match the first three letters of the text "jen123" but
        will return no matches for "jennifer". Dictionary words containing a
        large number of characters that are not letters or digits may result in
        unexpected findings because such characters are treated as whitespace.

            Config for storing transformation details. This field specifies the
            configuration for storing detailed metadata about each
            transformation performed during a de-identification process. The
            metadata is stored separately from the de-identified content itself
            and provides a granular record of both successful transformations
            and any failures that occurred. Enabling this configuration is
            essential for users who need to access comprehensive information
            about the status, outcome, and specifics of each transformation. The
            details are captured in the TransformationDetails message for each
            operation. Key use cases: * **Auditing and compliance** * Provides a
            verifiable audit trail of de-identification activities, which is
            crucial for meeting regulatory requirements and internal data
            governance policies. * Logs what data was transformed, what
            transformations were applied, when they occurred, and their success
            status. This helps demonstrate accountability and due diligence in
            protecting sensitive data. * **Troubleshooting and debugging** *
            Offers detailed error messages and context if a transformation
            fails. This information is useful for diagnosing and resolving
            issues in the de-identification pipeline. * Helps pinpoint the exact
            location and nature of failures, speeding up the debugging process.
            * **Process verification and quality assurance** * Allows users to
            confirm that de-identification rules and transformations were
            applied correctly and consistently across the dataset as intended. *
            Helps in verifying the effectiveness of the chosen de-identification
            strategies. * **Data lineage and impact analysis** * Creates a
            record of how data elements were modified, contributing to data
            lineage. This is useful for understanding the provenance of
            de-identified data. * Aids in assessing the potential impact of
            de-identification choices on downstream analytical processes or data
            usability. * **Reporting and operational insights** * You can
            analyze the metadata stored in a queryable BigQuery table to
            generate reports on transformation success rates, common error
            types, processing volumes (e.g., transformedBytes), and the types of
            transformations applied. * These insights can inform optimization of
            de-identification configurations and resource planning. To take
            advantage of these benefits, set this configuration. The stored
            details include a description of the transformation, success or
            error codes, error messages, the number of bytes transformed, the
            location of the transformed content, and identifiers for the job and
            source data.

        Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving
        Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in
        the `ReidentifyContent` API method, it serves the opposite function by
        reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The
        identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context,
        the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate.
        Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the
        identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See
        https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/pseudonymization
        to learn more. Note: We recommend using CryptoDeterministicConfig for
        all use cases which do not require preserving the input alphabet space
        and size, plus warrant referential integrity. FPE incurs significant
        latency costs.

            The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation
            will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of
            the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format:
            info_type_name(surrogate_character_count):surrogate For example, if
            the name of custom infoType is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the
            surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom infoType
            [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype).
            This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free
            text. In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this
            infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise,
            inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an
            actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name
            carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to
            select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection
            is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly
            improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is
            entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code
            point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE

          description: >-
            The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation
            will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of
            the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising
            the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type
            name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate} For example, if the
            name of custom info type is 'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE' and the surrogate
            is 'abc', the full replacement value will be:
            'MY_TOKEN_INFO_TYPE(3):abc' This annotation identifies the surrogate
            when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This
            facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.
            Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is
            being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used
            to denote the location of the token and are necessary for
            re-identification in free form text. In order for inspection to work
            properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally
            anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either - reverse a
            surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier - be
            unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error Therefore,
            choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what
            your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high
            chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more
            unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data.
            For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII
            keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like
            so: ⧝MY_TOKEN_TYPE.

            context is validated against the value used during encryption. If a
            context was provided during encryption, same context must be

            plaintext would be used as is for encryption. If the context is set

        and when de-identifying structured data we'll attempt to preserve the
        original data's type. (This allows you to take a long like 123 and
