            The etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in
            the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to
            GetPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request
            to SetPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied to the same
            version of the policy. If no etag is provided in the call to
            GetPolicy, then the existing policy is overwritten blindly.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
