      id: Policy
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
        roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
        user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
        condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access
        after Sep 2020 expression: request.time <
        timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ```

        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
      properties:
        version:
          format: int32
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when
            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
            resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
            special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet;
            with or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A
            special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with
            a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities
            that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity
            federation. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a
            specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *
            `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a
            Google service account. For example,
            `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *
            `serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]`:
            An identifier for a [Kubernetes service
            account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts).
            For example,
            `my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]`. *
            `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group.
            For example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite
            domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For
            example, `google.com` or `example.com`. *
            `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus
            unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently
            deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.
            If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and
            the recovered user retains the role in the binding. *
            `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address
            (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has
            been recently deleted. For example,
            `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`.
            If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
            `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains
            the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`:
            An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google
            group that has been recently deleted. For example,
            `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is
            recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered
            group retains the role in the binding.
        condition:
          description: >-
            The condition that is associated with this binding. If the condition
            evaluates to `true`, then this binding applies to the current
            request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding
            does not apply to the current request. However, a different role
            binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals
            in this binding. To learn which resources support conditions in
            their IAM policies, see the [IAM

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used

        binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and
        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
        Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc
        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes

        resources are intended to be fully-resolved descriptions of an
        ApiVersion. When specs consist of multiple files, these should be
        bundled together (e.g., in a zip archive) and stored as a unit. Multiple
        specs can exist to provide representations in different API description
        formats. Synchronization of these representations would be provided by

        Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the
        resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of permissions,
        not a `NOT_FOUND` error. Note: This operation is designed to be used for
        building permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for
        authorization checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.
