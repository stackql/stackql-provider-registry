        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Backup Redis Cluster. If this is the first time a backup is being
        created, a backup collection will be created at the backend, and this
        backup belongs to this collection. Both collection and backup will have
        a resource name. Backup will be executed for each shard. A replica
        (primary if nonHA) will be selected to perform the execution. Backup
        call will be rejected if there is an ongoing backup or update operation.
        Be aware that during preview, if the cluster's internal software version
        is too old, critical update will be performed before actual backup. Once
        the internal software version is updated to the minimum version required
        by the backup feature, subsequent backups will not require critical
        update. After preview, there will be no critical update needed for
        backup.
