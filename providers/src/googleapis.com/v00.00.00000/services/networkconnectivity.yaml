          description: >-
            Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
            request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server knows
            to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server
            guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate
            commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a
            situation where you make an initial request and the request times
            out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the
            server can check to see whether the original operation was received.
            If it was, the server ignores the second request. This behavior
            prevents clients from mistakenly creating duplicate commitments. The
            request ID must be a valid UUID, with the exception that zero UUID
            is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).

            out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the
            server can check to see whether the original operation was received.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        version:

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you

        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM

            - >-
              This is the default behavior and represents the case that this
              internal range is intended to be used in the VPC in which it is
              created and is accessible from its peers. This implies that peers
              or peers-of-peers cannot use this range.
            - >-
              This behavior can be set when the internal range is being reserved
              for usage by peers. This means that no resource within the VPC in
              which it is being created can use this to associate with a VPC
              resource, but one of the peers can. This represents donating a
              range for peers to use.

              This behavior can be set when the internal range is being reserved

              peers. In a sense, it is local to the VPC. This can be used to
              create internal ranges for various purposes like
              HTTP_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER or for Interconnect routes that are
              not shared with peers. This also implies that peers cannot use
              this range in a way that is visible to this VPC, but can re-use
              this range as long as it is NOT_SHARED from the peer VPC, too.

    AuditConfig:
      description: >-
        Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration
        determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if
        any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
        AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
        specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
        service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and
        the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy
        with multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service":
        "allServices", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ",
        "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type":

        "DATA_READ" }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE", "exempted_members": [
        "user:aliya@example.com" ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy
        enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts
        `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from
        DATA_WRITE logging.

        CheckConsumerConfig validates the consumer network and project for
        potential PSC connection creation. This method performs several checks,
        including: - Validating the existence and permissions of the service
        class. - Ensuring the consumer network exists and is accessible. -
        Verifying XPN relationships if applicable. - Checking for compatible IP
        versions between the consumer network and the requested version. This
        method performs a dynamic IAM check for the
        `networkconnectivity.serviceClasses.use` permission on the service class
        resource in the Prepare phase.

        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not

        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
