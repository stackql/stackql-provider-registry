          enumDescriptions:
            - If Peering is left unspecified in CreateInternalRange or UpdateInternalRange, it will be defaulted to FOR_SELF.
            - This is the default behavior and represents the case that this InternalRange is intended to be used in the VPC on which it is created and is accessible from it’s peers. This implies that peers or peer-of-peer’s cannot use this range.
            - This behavior can be set when the Internal Range is being reserved for usage by the peers. This means that no resource within the VPC in which it is being created can use this to associate with a GCP resource, but one of the peer’s can. This represents "donating" a range for peers to use.
            - This behavior can be set when the Internal Range is being reserved for usage by the VPC on which it is created but not shared with the peers. In a sense it is local to the VPC. This can be used to create Internal Ranges for various purposes like HTTP_INTERNAL_LOAD_BALANCER or for interconnect routes that are not shared with peers. This also implies that peer’s cannot use this range in a way that is visible to this VPC, but can re-use this range as long as it is NOT_SHARED from the peer VPC too.

            - A GCP resource can use the reserved CIDR block by associating it with the Internal Range resource if usage is set to FOR_VPC.
            - Ranges created with EXTERNAL_TO_VPC cannot be associated with GCP resources and are meant to block out address ranges for various use cases, like for example, usage on-prem, with dynamic route announcements via interconnect.

    Policy:
      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
