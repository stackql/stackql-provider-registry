        Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can
        represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset
        is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a
        particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is
        unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When
        neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day
        in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
        If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a
        specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to
        represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and
        either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using
        `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also
        would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done in another
        field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make
        sure to document and validate your application's limitations.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

            Optional. Maximum time the solver should spend on the problem. If
            not set, defaults to 1 minute. The choice of a time limit should
            depend on the size of the problem. To give an example, when solving
            a 7-day instance with 2 `ShiftTemplates`, each with ~20 possible
            start times and holding 2 events with ~30 possible start times, and
            two days off per week, recommended values are: <10s for fast
            solutions (and likely suboptimal), (10s, 300s) for good quality
            solutions, and >300s for an exhaustive search. Larger instances may
            require longer time limits. This value is not a hard limit and it
            does not account for the communication overhead. The expected
            latency to solve the problem may slightly exceed this value.

                This class is applicable when the principal has authenticated
                using a password to a local authentication authority, in order

                enclosed private key and a PIN.
              - >-
                The Software-PKI class is applicable when a principal uses an

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
