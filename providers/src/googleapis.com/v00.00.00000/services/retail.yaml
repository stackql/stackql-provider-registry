Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results. Using this field does not affect what search results are returned. For example, suppose there are 100 products with the color facet "Red" and 200 products with the color facet "Blue". A query containing the filter "colorFamilies:ANY("Red")" and having "colorFamilies" as FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" products in the search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue products available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "colorFamilies" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the "colorFamilies" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn't affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only "Red" products. A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error is returned.

To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.'

      description: 'Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.'

    post:
      description: Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last update timestamps of each inventory field. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update is enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. When inventory is updated with ProductService.CreateProduct and ProductService.UpdateProduct, the specified inventory field value(s) overwrite any existing value(s) while ignoring the last update time for this field. Furthermore, the last update times for the specified inventory fields are overwritten by the times of the ProductService.CreateProduct or ProductService.UpdateProduct request. If no inventory fields are set in CreateProductRequest.product, then any pre-existing inventory information for this product is used. If no inventory fields are set in SetInventoryRequest.set_mask, then any existing inventory information is preserved. Pre-existing inventory information can only be updated with ProductService.SetInventory, ProductService.AddFulfillmentPlaces, and ProductService.RemoveFulfillmentPlaces. The returned Operations is obsolete after one day, and the GetOperation API returns `NOT_FOUND` afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates are not marked as done until they are obsolete.
