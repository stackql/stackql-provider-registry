            boosted item will be the top result at all times, nor that other
            items will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none
            of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly
            more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily
            favored but irrelevant items. Setting to -1.0 gives the item a big
            demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be
            shown. The item will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high
            ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means
            no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.

            action are allowed, if a certain position in the map is already
            filled that `[position, product_id]` pair will be ignored but the
            rest may still be applied. This case will only occur if multiple pin
            actions are matched to a single request, as the map guarantees that
            pin positions are unique within the same action. Duplicate
            product_ids are not permitted within a single pin map. The max size
            of this map is 120, equivalent to the max [request page
            size](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.locations.catalogs.placements/search#request-body).

        Pins one or more specified products to a specific position in the
        results. * Rule Condition: Must specify non-empty Condition.query_terms
        (for search only) or Condition.page_categories (for browse only), but
        can't specify both. * Action Input: mapping of `[pin_position,
        product_id]` pairs (pin position uses 1-based indexing). * Action
        Result: Will pin products with matching ids to the position specified in
        the final result order. Example: Suppose the query is `shoes`, the
        Condition.query_terms is `shoes` and the pin_map has `{1, "pid1"}`, then
        product with `pid1` will be pinned to the top position in the final
        results. If multiple PinActions are matched to a single request the
        actions will be processed from most to least recently updated. Pins to
        positions larger than the max allowed page size of 120 are not allowed.

            `filterOutOfStockItems` flag. * Tag expressions. Restricts
            predictions to products that match all of the specified tags.
            Boolean operators `OR` and `NOT` are supported if the expression is
            enclosed in parentheses, and must be separated from the tag values
            by a space. `-"tagA"` is also supported and is equivalent to `NOT
            "tagA"`. Tag values must be double quoted UTF-8 encoded strings with
            a size limit of 1,000 characters. Note: "Recently viewed" models
            don't support tag filtering at the moment. * filterOutOfStockItems.
            Restricts predictions to products that do not have a stockState
            value of OUT_OF_STOCK. Examples: * tag=("Red" OR "Blue")
            tag="New-Arrival" tag=(NOT "promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems
            tag=(-"promotional") * filterOutOfStockItems If your filter blocks
            all prediction results, the API will return *no* results. If instead
            you want empty result sets to return generic (unfiltered) popular
            products, set `strictFiltering` to False in `PredictRequest.params`.
            Note that the API will never return items with storageStatus of
            "EXPIRED" or "DELETED" regardless of filter choices. If
            `filterSyntaxV2` is set to true under the `params` field, then
            attribute-based expressions are expected instead of the above
            described tag-based syntax. Examples: * (colors: ANY("Red", "Blue"))

            Custom attribute formatting must be consistent between imported
            events and events provided with prediction requests. This lets the
            Retail API use those custom attributes when training models and
            serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.
            This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an

            limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values
            are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user
            information is traffic_channel, which is how a user arrives at the

            List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is
            not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this field.
            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 products with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 products with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "colorFamilies:ANY("Red")" and having
            "colorFamilies" as FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red"
            products in the search results, and also return "Red" with count 100
            as the only color facet. Although there are also blue products
            available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If
            "colorFamilies" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query
            returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count
            200, because the "colorFamilies" key is now excluded from the
            filter. Because this field doesn't affect search results, the search
            results are still correctly filtered to return only "Red" products.
            A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT
            error is returned.
        enableDynamicPosition:
          description: >-
            Enables dynamic position for this facet. If set to true, the
            position of this facet among all facets in the response is
            determined by Google Retail Search. It is ordered together with
            dynamic facets if dynamic facets is enabled. If set to false, the
            position of this facet in the response is the same as in the
            request, and it is ranked before the facets with dynamic position
            enable and all dynamic facets. For example, you may always want to
            have rating facet returned in the response, but it's not necessarily
            to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can
            set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating
            facet in response is determined by Google Retail Search. Another
            example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: *
            "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true * "price",
            enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands", enable_dynamic_position
            = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which generates a
            facet "gender". Then, the final order of the facets in the response
            can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price",
            "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how Google Retail Search
            orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that "price"
            and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position because
            their enable_dynamic_position values are false.

            Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives
            the item a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that
            the boosted item will be the top result at all times, nor that other
            items will be excluded. Results could still be shown even when none
            of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly
            more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily
            favored but irrelevant items. Setting to -1.0 gives the item a big
            demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant might still be
            shown. The item will have an upstream battle to get a fairly high
            ranking, but it is not blocked out completely. Setting to 0.0 means
            no boost applied. The boosting condition is ignored.

    GoogleApiHttpBody:
      type: object
      description: >-
        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used
        for payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw
        binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and
        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
        Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc
        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes
        how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will
        continue to work unchanged.

        Updates local inventory information for a Product at a list of places,

        This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist
        before updating inventory information. If the request is valid, the
        update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when
        a response is returned, updates are not immediately manifested in the
        Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or
        ProductService.ListProducts. Local inventory information can only be
        modified using this method. ProductService.CreateProduct and
        ProductService.UpdateProduct has no effect on local inventories. The
        returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API
        will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the
        Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done
        until being obsolete.

        Updates inventory information for a Product while respecting the last

        is updated with ProductService.CreateProduct and

        inventory fields are overwritten by the times of the

        equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to
        `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches
        can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to
        test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers
        switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using
        `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as
        SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch.
        CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default
        branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch
        is very different from the old one. More specifically: *
        PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}.
        * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if
        branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events
        with products from branch {newBranch}.
