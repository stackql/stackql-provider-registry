Results could still be shown even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your heavily favored but irrelevant items. Setting to -1.0 gives the item a big demotion.

For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it''s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined by Google Retail Search. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which generates a facet "gender". Then, the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how Google Retail Search orders "gender" and "rating" facets.

A query containing the filter "colorFamilies:ANY("Red")" and having "colorFamilies" as FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" products in the search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue products available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "colorFamilies" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the "colorFamilies" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn''t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only "Red" products. A maximum of 100 values are allowed.

      description: 'Set a specified branch id as default branch. API methods such as SearchService.Search, ProductService.GetProduct, ProductService.ListProducts will treat requests using "default_branch" to the actual branch id set as default. For example, if `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1` is set as default, setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` is equivalent to setting SearchRequest.branch to `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/1`. Using multiple branches can be useful when developers would like to have a staging branch to test and verify for future usage. When it becomes ready, developers switch on the staging branch using this API while keeping using `projects/*/locations/*/catalogs/*/branches/default_branch` as SearchRequest.branch to route the traffic to this staging branch. CAUTION: If you have live predict/search traffic, switching the default branch could potentially cause outages if the ID space of the new branch is very different from the old one. More specifically: * PredictionService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch}. * SearchService will only return product IDs from branch {newBranch} (if branch is not explicitly set). * UserEventService will only join events with products from branch {newBranch}.'

ProductService.AddLocalInventories achieves the same results but provides more fine-grained control over ingesting local inventory data. Incrementally adds place IDs to Product.fulfillment_info.place_ids. This process is asynchronous and does not require the Product to exist before updating fulfillment information. If the request is valid, the update will be enqueued and processed downstream. As a consequence, when a response is returned, the added place IDs are not immediately manifested in the Product queried by ProductService.GetProduct or ProductService.ListProducts. The returned Operations will be obsolete after 1 day, and GetOperation API will return NOT_FOUND afterwards. If conflicting updates are issued, the Operations associated with the stale updates will not be marked as done until being obsolete.'
