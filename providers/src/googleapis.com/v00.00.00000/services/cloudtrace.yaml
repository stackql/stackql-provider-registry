  title: Cloud Trace API
  description: >-
    Sends application trace data to Cloud Trace for viewing. Trace data is
    collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other
    applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to
    interact with the Cloud Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument
    your application for Cloud Trace, we recommend using OpenTelemetry.

      description: >-
        A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested
        to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes
        the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for its sub-operations.
        A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do
        not need to be contiguous. There might be gaps or overlaps between spans
        in a trace.

            `[TRACE_ID]` is a unique identifier for a trace within a project; it
            is a 32-character hexadecimal encoding of a 16-byte array. It should
            not be zero. `[SPAN_ID]` is a unique identifier for a span within a
            trace; it is a 16-character hexadecimal encoding of an 8-byte array.

            Cloud Trace displays the description in the Cloud console. For
            example, the display name can be a qualified method name or a file
            name and a line number where the operation is called. A best
            practice is to use the same display name within an application and
            at the same call point. This makes it easier to correlate spans in
            different traces.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

            A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
            user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
            google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.

        A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
        empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the
        request or the response type of an API method. For instance: service Foo
        { rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
