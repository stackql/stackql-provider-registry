  description: 'Sends application trace data to Cloud Trace for viewing. Trace data is collected for all App Engine applications by default. Trace data from other applications can be provided using this API. This library is used to interact with the Cloud Trace API directly. If you are looking to instrument your application for Cloud Trace, we recommend using OpenTelemetry. '

    Span:
      type: object
      description: A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to be contiguous—there might be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
      id: Span
      properties:
        displayName:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/TruncatableString'
          description: Required. A description of the span's operation (up to 128 bytes). Cloud Trace displays the description in the Cloud console. For example, the display name can be a qualified method name or a file name and a line number where the operation is called. A best practice is to use the same display name within an application and at the same call point. This makes it easier to correlate spans in different traces.

            - Indicates that the span covers server-side handling of an RPC or other remote network request.
            - Indicates that the span covers the client-side wrapper around an RPC or other remote request.
            - Indicates that the span describes producer sending a message to a broker. Unlike client and server, there is no direct critical path latency relationship between producer and consumer spans (e.g. publishing a message to a pubsub service).
            - Indicates that the span describes consumer receiving a message from a broker. Unlike client and server, there is no direct critical path latency relationship between producer and consumer spans (e.g. receiving a message from a pubsub service subscription).
          description: Optional. Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context. For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using `CLIENT` (caller) and `SERVER` (callee) to identify an RPC call.
