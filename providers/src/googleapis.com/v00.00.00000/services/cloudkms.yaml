        An ImportJob can be used to create CryptoKeys and CryptoKeyVersions
        using pre-existing key material, generated outside of Cloud KMS. When an
        ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a "wrapping key", which is
        a public/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also
        known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the
        import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of
        import_method. When the wrapping key generation is complete, the state
        will be set to ACTIVE and the public_key can be fetched. The fetched
        public key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once
        the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new
        CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling
        ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with
        a single ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the
        wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to
        the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once
        expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key
        material that was wrapped with the ImportJob's public key. For more

    Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",

        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -

            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
