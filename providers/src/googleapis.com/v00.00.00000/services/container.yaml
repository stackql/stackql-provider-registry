            [PRIVATE FIELD] Pod CIDR size overprovisioning config for the
            nodepool. Pod CIDR size per node depends on max_pods_per_node. By
            default, the value of max_pods_per_node is rounded off to next power
            of 2 and we then double that to get the size of pod CIDR block per
            node. Example: max_pods_per_node of 30 would result in 64 IPs (/26).
            This config can disable the doubling of IPs (we still round off to
            next power of 2) Example: max_pods_per_node of 30 will result in 32
            IPs (/27) when overprovisioning is disabled.

            depending on machine type being used: 1. For pre-Gen3 machines,
            which support flexible numbers of local ssds, zero (or unset) means
            to disable using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. 2. For Gen3
            machines which dictate a specific number of local ssds, zero (or
            unset) means to use the default number of local ssds that goes with
            that machine type. For example, for a c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2
            local ssds would be provisioned. For c3-standard-8 (which doesn't

              Too Many Requests
            - >-
              The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
              non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
              guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
              `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just
              the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at
              a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set
              fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write
              sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
              retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For
              example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
              `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should
              not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
              Mapping: 400 Bad Request
            - >-
              The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
              such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
              guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
            - >-
              The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
              indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.
              For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
              if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1],
              but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an
              offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
              using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so
              that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for
              an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP

            flexible numbers of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to disable
            using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. The limit for this value is

            zone. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for
            more information. 2. For Gen3 machines which dictate a specific
            number of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to use the default
            number of local ssds that goes with that machine type. For example,
            for a c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2 local ssds would be provisioned.

        These upgrade settings control the level of parallelism and the level of

        nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable. maxSurge controls the
        number of additional nodes that can be added to the node pool
        temporarily for the time of the upgrade to increase the number of
        available nodes. (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of
        parallelism (how many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). Note:
        upgrades inevitably introduce some disruption since workloads need to be
        moved from old nodes to new, upgraded ones. Even if maxUnavailable=0,
        this holds true. (Disruption stays within the limits of
        PodDisruptionBudget, if it is configured.) Consider a hypothetical node
        pool with 5 nodes having maxSurge=2, maxUnavailable=1. This means the
        upgrade process upgrades 3 nodes simultaneously. It creates 2 additional
        (upgraded) nodes, then it brings down 3 old (not yet upgraded) nodes at
        the same time. This ensures that there are always at least 4 nodes
        available. These upgrade settings configure the upgrade strategy for the
        node pool. Use strategy to switch between the strategies applied to the
        node pool. If the strategy is ROLLING, use max_surge and max_unavailable
        to control the level of parallelism and the level of disruption caused
        by upgrade. 1. maxSurge controls the number of additional nodes that can
        be added to the node pool temporarily for the time of the upgrade to
        increase the number of available nodes. 2. maxUnavailable controls the
        number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable. 3.
        (maxUnavailable + maxSurge) determines the level of parallelism (how
        many nodes are being upgraded at the same time). If the strategy is
        BLUE_GREEN, use blue_green_settings to configure the blue-green upgrade
        related settings. 1. standard_rollout_policy is the default policy. The
        policy is used to control the way blue pool gets drained. The draining
        is executed in the batch mode. The batch size could be specified as
        either percentage of the node pool size or the number of nodes.
        batch_soak_duration is the soak time after each batch gets drained. 2.
        node_pool_soak_duration is the soak time after all blue nodes are

              [auto-upgrades](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-upgrades).
              This operation sets the progress field and may be canceled. The
              upgrade strategy depends on [node pool

              The cluster is being updated. This is a broad category of
              operations and includes operations that only change metadata as
              well as those that must recreate the entire cluster. If the
              control plane must be recreated, this will cause temporary
              downtime for zonal clusters. Some features require recreating the
              nodes as well. Those will be recreated as separate operations and
              the update may not be completely functional until the node pools
              recreations finish. Node recreations will generally follow
              [maintenance
              policies](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions).
              Some GKE-initiated operations use this type. This includes certain
              types of auto-upgrades and incident mitigations.

              autoprovisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning)

              This operation type is initiated by GKE, typically automatically.
              This operation may be concurrent with other operations and there
              may be multiple repairs occurring on the same node pool.

              The control plane is being resized. This operation type is
              initiated by GKE. These operations are often performed

            start and end time. For example, to have something repeat every
            weekday, you'd use: `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` To repeat
            some window daily (equivalent to the DailyMaintenanceWindow):

            `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU` This specifies how frequently
            the window starts. Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window
            every weekday, you'd use something like: ``` start time =
            2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400 end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400
            recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR ``` Windows can span
            multiple days. Eg, to make the window encompass every weekend from
            midnight Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC: ``` start time
            = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z end time = 2019-01-07T23:59:00Z recurrence =
            FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=SA ``` Note the start and end time's specific
            dates are largely arbitrary except to specify duration of the window
