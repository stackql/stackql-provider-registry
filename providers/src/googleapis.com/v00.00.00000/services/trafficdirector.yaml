The runtime keys ``re2.max_program_size.error_level`` and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` can be set to integers as the maximum program size or complexity that a compiled regex can have before an exception is thrown or a warning is logged, respectively. ``re2.max_program_size.error_level`` defaults to 100, and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` has no default if unset (will not check/log a warning). Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the histogram `re2.program_size`, which records the program size, and the counter `re2.exceeded_warn_level`, which is incremented each time the program size exceeds the warn level threshold.'
