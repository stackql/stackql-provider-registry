If the index already exists, the call will return an `ALREADY_EXISTS` status. During index creation, the process could result in an error, in which case the index will move to the `ERROR` state. The process can be recovered by fixing the data that caused the error, removing the index with delete, then re-creating the index with create. Indexes with a single property cannot be created.
