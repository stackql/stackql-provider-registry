            Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key
            property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is
            defined by the customer in their schema. For example a media
            customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this case the

            Optional. The ranking expression controls the customized ranking on

            depend on the `ranking_expression_backend` value. If
            `ranking_expression_backend` is not provided, it defaults to
            `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`. If ranking_expression_backend is not provided
            or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single function or
            multiple functions that are joined by "+". * ranking_expression =
            function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: * double *
            relevance_score * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path) Function
            variables: * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for
            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
            `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN,
            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
            `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
            rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
            rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal
            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

            get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely.

            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.

            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position
            to true so that the position of rating facet in response is
            determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the
            following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position
            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position

            Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key
            property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is
            defined by the customer in their schema. For example a media
            customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this case the

            syntax](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/filter-search-metadata#filter-expression-syntax).
            Currently, the only supported condition is a list of BCP-47 lang
            codes. Example: * To boost suggestions in languages `en` or `fr`:
            `(lang_code: ANY("en", "fr"))`

        boost:
          description: >-
            Strength of the boost, which should be in [-1, 1]. Negative boost
            means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives the suggestions
            a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean that the top
            result will be a boosted suggestion. Setting to -1.0 gives the
            suggestions a big demotion. However, other suggestions that are
            relevant might still be shown. Setting to 0.0 means no boost
            applied. The boosting condition is ignored.

            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the documents
            being filtered. Filter expression is case-sensitive. This will be
            used to filter search results which may affect the summary response.
            If this field is unrecognizable, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is returned.
            Filtering in Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key
            to a key property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this
            mapping is defined by the customer in their schema. For example a
            media customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this
            case the filter would look like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king

            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the documents
            being filtered. Filter expression is case-sensitive. This will be
            used to filter search results which may affect the Answer response.
            If this field is unrecognizable, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is returned.
            Filtering in Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key
            to a key property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this
            mapping is defined by the customer in their schema. For example a
            media customers might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this
            case the filter would look like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king

            (available: true) AND (language: ANY("en", "es")) OR (categories:

            strictly matching the filters, set `strictFiltering` to `true` in

            indicates the probability of a Document conversion given the user's
            context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default.
            If set to `false`, the service returns generic (unfiltered) popular

            behavior in a time span. A general guideline to populate the
            session_id: 1. If user has no activity for 30 min, a new session_id
            should be assigned. 2. The session_id should be unique across users,
            suggest use uuid or add UserEvent.user_pseudo_id as prefix.

            custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the
            user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom
            attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and
            events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery
            Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and
            serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.
            This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an
            `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8

            attributes, at most 400 values are allowed. Empty values are not
            allowed. Each value must be a UTF-8 encoded string with a length
            limit of 256 characters. * For number attributes, at most 400 values
            are allowed. For product recommendations, an example of extra user

        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
        Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc
        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes

            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for

            is unrecognizable, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is returned. Filtering in
            Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key
            property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is
            defined by the customer in their schema. For example a media
            customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this case the

            expansion is needed. In the case a query does not have a sufficient

            Optional. The ranking expression controls the customized ranking on

            ServingConfig.ranking_expression. The syntax and supported features
            depend on the `ranking_expression_backend` value. If
            `ranking_expression_backend` is not provided, it defaults to
            `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`. If ranking_expression_backend is not provided
            or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single function or
            multiple functions that are joined by "+". * ranking_expression =
            function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: * double *
            relevance_score * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path) Function
            variables: * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for
            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
            `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN,
            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
            `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
            rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
            rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal
            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

            List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is
            not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this field.
            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.

            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position
            to true so that the position of rating facet in response is
            determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the
            following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position
            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position
            because their enable_dynamic_position is false.

          description: >-
            The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as described

            then omit this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum of the
            values in `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count` field
            of the distribution. If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N
            values, where N is the number of buckets specified in
            `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N values, the remaining
            values are assumed to be 0. The order of the values in
            `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering schemes described for
            the three bucket types. The first value must be the count for the
            underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the counts for
            the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N'th value in
            `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).

      description: >-
        `BucketOptions` describes the bucket boundaries used to create a
        histogram for the distribution. The buckets can be in a linear sequence,
        an exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly.
        `BucketOptions` does not include the number of values in each bucket. A
        bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the
        values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket
        must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets
        for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or
        more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket
        (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i
        (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span
        the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is
        -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The
        finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite.

            Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key
            property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is
            defined by the customer in their schema. For example a media
            customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this case the

            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
            `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN,
            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
            `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
            rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
            rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal
            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

            List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is

            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.

            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position
            to true so that the position of rating facet in response is
            determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the
            following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position
            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        completes, some Documents might still be returned by
        DocumentService.GetDocument or DocumentService.ListDocuments. To get a
        list of the Documents to be deleted, set PurgeDocumentsRequest.force to
        false.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server

        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
