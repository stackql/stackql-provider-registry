For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue documents available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn''t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100 values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.'
