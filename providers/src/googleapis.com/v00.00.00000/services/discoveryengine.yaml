Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results. Using this field does not affect what search results are returned. For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only color facet. Although there are also blue documents available, "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field doesn''t affect search results, the search results are still correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100 values are allowed.

For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it''s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position to true so that the position of rating facet in response is determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands", enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating", "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position because their enable_dynamic_position is false.'
