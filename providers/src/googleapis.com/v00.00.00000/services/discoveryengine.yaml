            This only stores models whose states are overridden by the admin.
            When the state is unspecified, or model_configs is empty for this
            model, the system will decide if this model should be available or
            not based on the default configuration. For example, a preview model
            should be disabled by default if the admin has not chosen to enable
            it.

            calls): Call /search API with the session ID generated in the first
            call. Here, the previous search query gets considered in query
            standing. I.e., if the first query is "How did Alphabet do in 2022?"
            and the current query is "How about 2023?", the current query will
            be interpreted as "How did Alphabet do in 2023?". Example #2
            (coordination between /search API calls and /answer API calls): Call
            /answer API with the session ID generated in the first call. Here,
            the answer generation happens in the context of the search results
            from the first search call. Multi-turn Search feature is currently

            `ranking_expression_backend` is not provided, it defaults to
            `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`. If ranking_expression_backend is not provided
            or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single function or
            multiple functions that are joined by "+". * ranking_expression =
            function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: * double *
            relevance_score * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path) Function
            variables: * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for
            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of

            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if

            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

            Filtering in Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key
            to a key property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this
            mapping is defined by the customer in their schema. For example a
            media customers might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this
            case the filter would look like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king

            Values above 300 are coerced to 300. For aggregation in healthcare
            search, when the [FacetKey.key] is "healthcare_aggregation_key", the
            limit will be overridden to 10,000 internally, regardless of the

            List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is
            not excluded from the filter unless it is listed in this field.
            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.

        enableDynamicPosition:

            Enables dynamic position for this facet. If set to true, the
            position of this facet among all facets in the response is

            ordered together. If set to false, the position of this facet in the
            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position
            to true so that the position of rating facet in response is
            determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the
            following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position
            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position
            because their enable_dynamic_position is false.

            Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives
            the document a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean
            that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor
            that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown
            even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are
            significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your
            heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the
            document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant
            might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to
            get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely.
            Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is
            ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the
            boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global

            call. Here, the previous search query gets considered in query
            standing. I.e., if the first query is "How did Alphabet do in 2022?"
            and the current query is "How about 2023?", the current query will
            be interpreted as "How did Alphabet do in 2023?". Example #2

            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
            `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN,
            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
            `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
            rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
            rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal
            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

          description: >-
            The attribute type to be used to determine the boost amount. The
            attribute value can be derived from the field value of the specified
            field_name. In the case of numerical it is straightforward i.e.
            attribute_value = numerical_field_value. In the case of freshness
            however, attribute_value = (time.now() - datetime_field_value).

              numerical field for which the boost_amount is specified.

              For the freshness use case the attribute value will be the
              duration between the current time and the date in the datetime
              field specified. The value must be formatted as an XSD
              `dayTimeDuration` value (a restricted subset of an ISO 8601
              duration value). The pattern for this is: `nDnM]`. For example,

            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position

            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position

            List of keys to exclude when faceting. By default, FacetKey.key is

            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used

        binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and
        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
        Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc
        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes
        how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will
        continue to work unchanged.

            These attributes must NOT contain data that needs to be parsed or

            custom attributes for ingested user events, also include them in the
            user events that you associate with prediction requests. Custom
            attribute formatting must be consistent between imported events and
            events provided with prediction requests. This lets the Discovery
            Engine API use those custom attributes when training models and
            serving predictions, which helps improve recommendation quality.
            This field needs to pass all below criteria, otherwise an
            `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned: * The key must be a UTF-8

          description: >-
            Specifies whether to filter out adversarial queries. The default
            value is `false`. Google employs search-query classification to
            detect adversarial queries. No summary is returned if the search
            query is classified as an adversarial query. For example, a user
            might ask a question regarding negative comments about the company
            or submit a query designed to generate unsafe, policy-violating
            output. If this field is set to `true`, we skip generating summaries
            for adversarial queries and return fallback messages instead.

            search results are used regardless of relevance to generate answers.

          description: >-
            Specifies whether to filter out queries that are not
            summary-seeking. The default value is `false`. Google employs
            search-query classification to detect summary-seeking queries. No
            summary is returned if the search query is classified as a
            non-summary seeking query. For example, `why is the sky blue` and
            `Who is the best soccer player in the world?` are summary-seeking
            queries, but `SFO airport` and `world cup 2026` are not. They are
            most likely navigational queries. If this field is set to `true`, we
            skip generating summaries for non-summary seeking queries and return
            fallback messages instead.
        summaryResultCount:

            summary is generated from all of the results. At most 10 results for
            documents mode, or 50 for chunks mode, can be used to generate a
            summary. The chunks mode is used when
            SearchRequest.ContentSearchSpec.search_result_mode is set to CHUNKS.

            Specifies whether to include citations in the summary. The default
            value is `false`. When this field is set to `true`, summaries
            include in-line citation numbers. Example summary including
            citations: BigQuery is Google Cloud's fully managed and completely
            serverless enterprise data warehouse [1]. BigQuery supports all data
            types, works across clouds, and has built-in machine learning and
            business intelligence, all within a unified platform [2, 3]. The
            citation numbers refer to the returned search results and are
            1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to
            the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is
            attributed to both the second and third search results.

            Enables dynamic position for this facet. If set to true, the

            ordered together. If set to false, the position of this facet in the
            response is the same as in the request, and it is ranked before the
            facets with dynamic position enable and all dynamic facets. For
            example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the
            response, but it's not necessarily to always display the rating
            facet at the top. In that case, you can set enable_dynamic_position
            to true so that the position of rating facet in response is
            determined automatically. Another example, assuming you have the
            following facets in the request: * "rating", enable_dynamic_position
            = true * "price", enable_dynamic_position = false * "brands",
            enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets
            enabled, which generates a facet `gender`. Then the final order of
            the facets in the response can be ("price", "brands", "rating",
            "gender") or ("price", "brands", "gender", "rating") depends on how
            API orders "gender" and "rating" facets. However, notice that
            "price" and "brands" are always ranked at first and second position
            because their enable_dynamic_position is false.

            Listing a facet key in this field allows its values to appear as
            facet results, even when they are filtered out of search results.
            Using this field does not affect what search results are returned.
            For example, suppose there are 100 documents with the color facet
            "Red" and 200 documents with the color facet "Blue". A query
            containing the filter "color:ANY("Red")" and having "color" as
            FacetKey.key would by default return only "Red" documents in the
            search results, and also return "Red" with count 100 as the only
            color facet. Although there are also blue documents available,
            "Blue" would not be shown as an available facet value. If "color" is
            listed in "excludedFilterKeys", then the query returns the facet
            values "Red" with count 100 and "Blue" with count 200, because the
            "color" key is now excluded from the filter. Because this field
            doesn't affect search results, the search results are still
            correctly filtered to return only "Red" documents. A maximum of 100
            values are allowed. Otherwise, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is
            returned.
        limit:
          format: int32
          type: integer
          description: >-
            Maximum facet values that are returned for this facet. If
            unspecified, defaults to 20. The maximum allowed value is 300.
            Values above 300 are coerced to 300. For aggregation in healthcare
            search, when the [FacetKey.key] is "healthcare_aggregation_key", the
            limit will be overridden to 10,000 internally, regardless of the
            value set here. If this field is negative, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is
            returned.

        `Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values.
        It optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of
        those values across a set of buckets. The summary statistics are the
        count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum,
        and the maximum of the set of population of values. The histogram is
        based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values that fall
        into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either
        explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially
        increasing widths. Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad
        idea to include non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population
        of values, as this will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation`
        fields meaningless.

            values, where N is the number of buckets specified in
            `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N values, the remaining
            values are assumed to be 0. The order of the values in
            `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering schemes described for
            the three bucket types. The first value must be the count for the
            underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the counts for
            the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N'th value in
            `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).

            `(filter_tags: ANY("Red", "Blue")) AND NOT (filter_tags:

            (available: true) AND (language: ANY("en", "es")) OR (categories:
            ANY("Movie")) If your filter blocks all results, the API returns
            generic (unfiltered) popular Documents. If you only want results
            strictly matching the filters, set `strictFiltering` to `true` in
            RecommendRequest.params to receive empty results instead. Note that

            Boolean. If set to true, the recommendation score corresponding to
            each returned Document is set in
            RecommendResponse.RecommendationResult.metadata. The given score
            indicates the probability of a Document conversion given the user's
            context and history. * `strictFiltering`: Boolean. True by default.
            If set to `false`, the service returns generic (unfiltered) popular
            Documents instead of empty if your filter blocks all recommendation
            results. * `diversityLevel`: String. Default empty. If set to be
            non-empty, then it needs to be one of: * `no-diversity` *
            `low-diversity` * `medium-diversity` * `high-diversity` *
            `auto-diversity` This gives request-level control and adjusts
            recommendation results based on Document category. *
            `attributeFilteringSyntax`: Boolean. False by default. If set to

        includeCitations:

            citation numbers refer to the returned search results and are
            1-indexed. For example, [1] means that the sentence is attributed to
            the first search result. [2, 3] means that the sentence is

        neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day

        If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a

            Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives
            the document a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean
            that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor
            that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown
            even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are
            significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your
            heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the
            document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant
            might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to
            get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely.
            Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is
            ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the
            boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global
            boost is ignored and the more fine-grained boost_control_spec is
            applied.

            embedding field used with query embedding vector. * `dotProduct`:

            vector. Example ranking expression: If document has an embedding
            field doc_embedding, the ranking expression could be `0.5 *

            Negative boost means demotion. Default is 0.0. Setting to 1.0 gives
            the document a big promotion. However, it does not necessarily mean
            that the boosted document will be the top result at all times, nor
            that other documents will be excluded. Results could still be shown
            even when none of them matches the condition. And results that are
            significantly more relevant to the search query can still trump your
            heavily favored but irrelevant documents. Setting to -1.0 gives the
            document a big demotion. However, results that are deeply relevant
            might still be shown. The document will have an upstream battle to
            get a fairly high ranking, but it is not blocked out completely.
            Setting to 0.0 means no boost applied. The boosting condition is
            ignored. Only one of the (condition, boost) combination or the
            boost_control_spec below are set. If both are set then the global

        `BucketOptions` describes the bucket boundaries used to create a
        histogram for the distribution. The buckets can be in a linear sequence,
        an exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly.
        `BucketOptions` does not include the number of values in each bucket. A
        bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the
        values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket
        must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets
        for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or
        more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket
        (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i
        (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span
        the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is
        -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The
        finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite.

              `dayTimeDuration` value (a restricted subset of an ISO 8601
              duration value). The pattern for this is: `nDnM]`. For example,

            single data store, the specs directly under SearchRequest should be
            used.

          description: >-
            The filter syntax consists of an expression language for
            constructing a predicate from one or more fields of the documents
            being filtered. Filter expression is case-sensitive. If this field
            is unrecognizable, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` is returned. Filtering in
            Vertex AI Search is done by mapping the LHS filter key to a key
            property defined in the Vertex AI Search backend -- this mapping is
            defined by the customer in their schema. For example a media
            customer might have a field 'name' in their schema. In this case the
            filter would look like this: filter --> name:'ANY("king kong")' For

            The default filter that is applied when a user performs a search
            without checking any filters on the search page. The filter applied
            to every search request when quality improvement such as query
            expansion is needed. In the case a query does not have a sufficient
            amount of results this filter will be used to determine whether or
            not to enable the query expansion flow. The original filter will
            still be used for the query expanded search. This field is strongly

            ServingConfig.ranking_expression. The syntax and supported features
            depend on the `ranking_expression_backend` value. If
            `ranking_expression_backend` is not provided, it defaults to
            `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`. If ranking_expression_backend is not provided
            or set to `RANK_BY_EMBEDDING`, it should be a single function or
            multiple functions that are joined by "+". * ranking_expression =
            function, { " + ", function }; Supported functions: * double *
            relevance_score * double * dotProduct(embedding_field_path) Function
            variables: * `relevance_score`: pre-defined keywords, used for
            measure relevance between query and document. *
            `embedding_field_path`: the document embedding field used with query
            embedding vector. * `dotProduct`: embedding function between
            `embedding_field_path` and query embedding vector. Example ranking
            expression: If document has an embedding field doc_embedding, the
            ranking expression could be `0.5 * relevance_score + 0.3 *
            dotProduct(doc_embedding)`. If ranking_expression_backend is set to
            `RANK_BY_FORMULA`, the following expression types (and combinations
            of those chained using + or * operators) are supported: * `double` *
            `signal` * `log(signal)` * `exp(signal)` * `rr(signal, double > 0)`
            -- reciprocal rank transformation with second argument being a
            denominator constant. * `is_nan(signal)` -- returns 0 if signal is
            NaN, 1 otherwise. * `fill_nan(signal1, signal2 | double)` -- if
            signal1 is NaN, returns signal2 | double, else returns signal1. Here
            are a few examples of ranking formulas that use the supported
            ranking expression types: - `0.2 * semantic_similarity_score + 0.8 *
            log(keyword_similarity_score)` -- mostly rank by the logarithm of
            `keyword_similarity_score` with slight `semantic_smilarity_score`
            adjustment. - `0.2 * exp(fill_nan(semantic_similarity_score, 0)) +
            0.3 * is_nan(keyword_similarity_score)` -- rank by the exponent of
            `semantic_similarity_score` filling the value with 0 if it's NaN,
            also add constant 0.3 adjustment to the final score if
            `semantic_similarity_score` is NaN. - `0.2 *
            rr(semantic_similarity_score, 16) + 0.8 *
            rr(keyword_similarity_score, 16)` -- mostly rank by the reciprocal
            rank of `keyword_similarity_score` with slight adjustment of
            reciprocal rank of `semantic_smilarity_score`. The following signals
            are supported: * `semantic_similarity_score`: semantic similarity
            adjustment that is calculated using the embeddings generated by a
            proprietary Google model. This score determines how semantically
            similar a search query is to a document. *
            `keyword_similarity_score`: keyword match adjustment uses the Best
            Match 25 (BM25) ranking function. This score is calculated using a
            probabilistic model to estimate the probability that a document is
            relevant to a given query. * `relevance_score`: semantic relevance
            adjustment that uses a proprietary Google model to determine the
            meaning and intent behind a user's query in context with the content
            in the documents. * `pctr_rank`: predicted conversion rate
            adjustment as a rank use predicted Click-through rate (pCTR) to
            gauge the relevance and attractiveness of a search result from a
            user's perspective. A higher pCTR suggests that the result is more
            likely to satisfy the user's query and intent, making it a valuable
            signal for ranking. * `freshness_rank`: freshness adjustment as a
            rank * `document_age`: The time in hours elapsed since the document
            was last updated, a floating-point number (e.g., 0.25 means 15
            minutes). * `topicality_rank`: topicality adjustment as a rank. Uses
            proprietary Google model to determine the keyword-based overlap
            between the query and the document. * `base_rank`: the default rank
            of the result

            This field is the equivalent of the query for browse (navigation)
            queries. It's used by the browse model when the query is empty. If
            the field is empty, it will not be used by the browse model. If the
            field contains more than one element, only the first element will be
            used. To represent full path of a category, use '>' character to
            separate different hierarchies. If '>' is part of the category name,
            replace it with other character(s). For example, `Graphics Cards >
            RTX>4090 > Founders Edition` where "RTX > 4090" represents one
            level, can be rewritten as `Graphics Cards > RTX_4090 > Founders

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Performs a search. Similar to the SearchService.Search method, but a
        lite version that allows API key for authentication, where OAuth and IAM
        checks are not required. Only public website search is supported by this
        method. If data stores and engines not associated with public website
        search are specified, a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error is returned. This
        method can be used for easy onboarding without having to implement an
        authentication backend. However, it is strongly recommended to use
        SearchService.Search instead with required OAuth and IAM checks to
        provide better data security.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
