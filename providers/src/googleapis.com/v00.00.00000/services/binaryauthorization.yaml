            The signature algorithm used to verify a message against a signature
            using this key. These signature algorithm must match the structure

            field exactly. The ID may be explicitly provided by the caller, but
            it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If `key_id` is left blank and this

            in the context of a wrapper that has its own notion of key ID (e.g.
            `AttestorPublicKey`), then this field can either match that value
            exactly, or be left blank, in which case it behaves exactly as

        Verifiers (e.g. Kritis implementations) MUST verify signatures with
        respect to the trust anchors defined in policy (e.g. a Kritis policy).
        Typically this means that the verifier has been configured with a map
        from `public_key_id` to public key material (and any required
        parameters, e.g. signing algorithm). In particular, verification
        implementations MUST NOT treat the signature `public_key_id` as anything
        more than a key lookup hint. The `public_key_id` DOES NOT validate or
        authenticate a public key; it only provides a mechanism for quickly
        selecting a public key ALREADY CONFIGURED on the verifier through a
        trusted channel. Verification implementations MUST reject signatures in
        any of the following circumstances: * The `public_key_id` is not
        recognized by the verifier. * The public key that `public_key_id` refers
        to does not verify the signature with respect to the payload. The
        `signature` contents SHOULD NOT be "attached" (where the payload is
        included with the serialized `signature` bytes). Verifiers MUST ignore
        any "attached" payload and only verify signatures with respect to
        explicitly provided payload (e.g. a `payload` field on the proto message
        that holds this Signature, or the canonical serialization of the proto
        message that holds this signature).

          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        version:
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            the behavior is "always allow"). If multiple `CheckSet` objects have

            match. `CheckSet` objects must be listed in order of decreasing
            specificity, i.e. if a scope matches a given service account (which
            must include the namespace), it must come before a `CheckSet` with a
            scope matching just that namespace. This property is enforced by
            server-side validation. The purpose of this restriction is to ensure
            that if more than one `CheckSet` matches a given Pod, the `CheckSet`
            that will be evaluated will always be the first in the list to match
            (because if any other matches, it must be less specific). If
            `check_sets` is empty, the default behavior is to allow all images.
            If `check_sets` is non-empty, the last `check_sets` entry must
            always be a `CheckSet` with no scope set, i.e. a catchall to handle
            any situation not caught by the preceding `CheckSet` objects.

            `https://source.cloud.google.com/my-project/my-repo-name` A pattern
            matches a URL either exactly or with `*` wildcards. `*` can be used
            in only two ways: 1. trailing `*` after hosturi/ to match varying
            endings; 2. trailing `**` after hosturi/ to match `/` as well. `*`
            and `**` can only be used as wildcards and can only occur at the end
            of the pattern after a `/`. (So it's not possible to match a URL
            that contains literal `*`.) For example: -
            `github.com/my-project/my-repo` is valid to match a single repo -
            `github.com/my-project/*` will match all direct repos in
