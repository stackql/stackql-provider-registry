          description: >-
            The default value for event-based hold on newly created objects in
            this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain objects
            indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's release.
            After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-level
            retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks to
            hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full.
            Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being
            paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for
            any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold
            on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That
            means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment
            event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under
            event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until
            the hold is removed.

        eventBasedHold:

            Whether an object is under event-based hold. Event-based hold is a
            way to retain objects until an event occurs, which is signified by
            the hold's release (i.e. this value is set to false). After being
            released (set to false), such objects will be subject to
            bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is
            for banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is
            paid in full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event
            is the loan being paid in full. In this example, these objects will
            be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred
            (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years
            after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from
            the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false.

                  A collection of identifiers for members who may assume the

                  - user:emailid — An email address that represents a specific
                  account. For example, user:alice@gmail.com or

                  - serviceAccount:emailid — An email address that represents a
                  service account. For example,

                  - group:emailid — An email address that represents a Google
                  group. For example, group:admins@example.com.  

                  - domain:domain — A Google Apps domain name that represents
                  all the users of that domain. For example, domain:google.com

                  The role to which members belong. Two types of roles are
                  supported: new IAM roles, which grant permissions that do not
                  map directly to those provided by ACLs, and legacy IAM roles,
                  which do map directly to ACL permissions. All roles are of the
                  format roles/storage.specificRole.

                  The new IAM roles are:  

                  - roles/storage.admin — Full control of Google Cloud Storage
                  resources.  

                  - roles/storage.objectViewer — Read-Only access to Google

                  - roles/storage.objectCreator — Access to create objects in
                  Google Cloud Storage.  

                  - roles/storage.objectAdmin — Full control of Google Cloud
                  Storage objects.   The legacy IAM roles are:  

                  - roles/storage.legacyObjectReader — Read-only access to
                  objects without listing. Equivalent to an ACL entry on an
                  object with the READER role.  

                  - roles/storage.legacyObjectOwner — Read/write access to
                  existing objects without listing. Equivalent to an ACL entry
                  on an object with the OWNER role.  

                  - roles/storage.legacyBucketReader — Read access to buckets
                  with object listing. Equivalent to an ACL entry on a bucket
                  with the READER role.  

                  - roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter — Read access to buckets
                  with object listing/creation/deletion. Equivalent to an ACL
                  entry on a bucket with the WRITER role.  

                  - roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner — Read and write access to
                  existing buckets with object listing/creation/deletion.
                  Equivalent to an ACL entry on a bucket with the OWNER role.
