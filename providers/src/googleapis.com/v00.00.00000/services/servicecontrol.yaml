For example, `//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed`. * URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can be used directly by applications. For example, `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed`. See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names for details.'
