        enrolledServices:
          description: A list of Google Cloud Services for which the given resource has Access Approval enrolled. Access requests for the resource given by name against any of these services contained here will be required to have explicit approval. If name refers to an organization, enrollment can be done for individual services. If name refers to a folder or project, enrollment can only be done on an all or nothing basis. If a cloud_product is repeated in this list, the first entry will be honored and all following entries will be discarded. A maximum of 10 enrolled services will be enforced, to be expanded as the set of supported services is expanded.
