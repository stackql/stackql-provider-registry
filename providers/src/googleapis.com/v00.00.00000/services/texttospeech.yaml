This should not include a script tag (e.g. use "cmn-cn" rather than "cmn-Hant-cn"), because the script will be inferred from the input provided in the SynthesisInput. The TTS service will use this parameter to help choose an appropriate voice. Note that the TTS service may choose a voice with a slightly different language code than the one selected; it may substitute a different region (e.g. using en-US rather than en-CA if there isn't a Canadian voice available), or even a different language, e.g. using "nb" (Norwegian Bokmal) instead of "no" (Norwegian)".

          description: The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement; if a voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
          enumDescriptions:
            - An unspecified gender. In VoiceSelectionParams, this means that the client doesn't care which gender the selected voice will have. In the Voice field of ListVoicesResponse, this may mean that the voice doesn't fit any of the other categories in this enum, or that the gender of the voice isn't known.

Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.

          format: int32
          type: integer
          description: Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. When this is specified in SynthesizeSpeechRequest, if this is different from the voice's natural sample rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the desired sample rate (which might result in worse audio quality), unless the specified sample rate is not supported for the encoding chosen, in which case it will fail the request and return google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
        audioEncoding:
          enumDescriptions:
            - Not specified. Will return result google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT.
            - Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM). Audio content returned as LINEAR16 also contains a WAV header.
            - MP3 audio at 32kbps.
            - Opus encoded audio wrapped in an ogg container. The result will be a file which can be played natively on Android, and in browsers (at least Chrome and Firefox). The quality of the encoding is considerably higher than MP3 while using approximately the same bitrate.
            - 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU/mu-law. Audio content returned as MULAW also contains a WAV header.
            - 8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711 PCMU/A-law. Audio content returned as ALAW also contains a WAV header.
          description: Required. The format of the audio byte stream.

        volumeGainDb:
          description: Optional. Input only. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that.

        pitch:

If the original method is standard `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.'

If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
