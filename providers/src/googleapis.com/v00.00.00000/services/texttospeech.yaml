              For reading-to-pron conversion to work well, the `pronunciation`
              field should only contain Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana. The
              pronunciation can also contain pitch accents. The start of a pitch
              phrase is specified with `^` and the down-pitch position is
              specified with `!`, for example: phrase:端 pronunciation:^はし
              phrase:箸 pronunciation:^は!し phrase:橋 pronunciation:^はし! We
              currently only support the Tokyo dialect, which allows at most one
              down-pitch per phrase (i.e. at most one `!` between `^`).

        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
