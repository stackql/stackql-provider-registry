              The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
              non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
              guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
              `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just
              the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at
              a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set
              fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write
              sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
              retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For
              example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
              `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should
              not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
              Mapping: 400 Bad Request

              The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
              such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
              guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
            - >-
              The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
              indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.
              For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
              if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1],
              but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an
              offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
              using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so
              that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for
              an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP

        messageBindingTemplate:
          description: >-
            Optional. The CEL expression used to modify how the
            destination-bound HTTP request is constructed. If a binding
            expression is not specified here, the message is treated as a
            CloudEvent and is mapped to the HTTP request according to the
            CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary Content Mode
            (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
            In this representation, all fields except the `data` and
            `datacontenttype` field on the message are mapped to HTTP request
            headers with a prefix of `ce-`. To construct the HTTP request
            payload and the value of the content-type HTTP header, the payload
            format is defined as follows: 1) Use the output_payload_format_type
            on the Pipeline.Destination if it is set, else: 2) Use the
            input_payload_format_type on the Pipeline if it is set, else: 3)
            Treat the payload as opaque binary data. The `data` field of the
            message is converted to the payload format or left as-is for case 3)
            and then attached as the payload of the HTTP request. The
            `content-type` header on the HTTP request is set to the payload
            format type or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation has
            updated the `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not
            the same as the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the
            payload format type, then the `content-type` header on the HTTP
            request is set to this `datacontenttype` value. For example, if the
            `datacontenttype` is "application/json" and the payload format type
            is "application/json; charset=utf-8", then the `content-type` header
            on the HTTP request is set to "application/json; charset=utf-8". If
            a non-empty binding expression is specified then this expression is
            used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
            Content representation. The result of the CEL expression must be a
            map of key/value pairs which is used as follows: - If a map named
            `headers` exists on the result of the expression, then its key/value
            pairs are directly mapped to the HTTP request headers. The headers
            values are constructed from the corresponding value type's canonical
            representation. If the `headers` field doesn't exist then the
            resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the CloudEvent HTTP
            Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the final message.
            Note: If the specified binding expression, has updated the
            `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not the same as
            the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the payload
            format type, then the `content-type` header in the `headers` map is
            set to this `datacontenttype` value. - If a field named `body`
            exists on the result of the expression then its value is directly
            mapped to the body of the request. If the value of the `body` field
            is of type bytes or string then it is used for the HTTP request body
            as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is of any other type
            then it is converted to a JSON string. If the body field does not
            exist then the resulting payload of the HTTP request will be data
            value of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
            representation of the final message as described earlier. - Any
            other fields in the resulting expression will be ignored. The CEL
            expression may access the incoming CloudEvent message in its
            definition, as follows: - The `data` field of the incoming
            CloudEvent message can be accessed using the `message.data` value.
            Subfields of `message.data` may also be accessed if an
            input_payload_format has been specified on the Pipeline. - Each
            attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed using
            the `message.` value, where is replaced with the name of the
            attribute. - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression
            using the `headers` variable. The `headers` variable defines a map
            of key/value pairs corresponding to the HTTP headers of the
            CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the
            final message as described earlier. For example, the following CEL
            expression can be used to construct an HTTP request by adding an
            additional header to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding
            Binary Content Mode representation of the final message and by
            overwriting the body of the request: ``` { "headers":
            headers.merge({"new-header-key": "new-header-value"}), "body":
            "new-body" } ``` - The default binding for the message payload can
            be accessed using the `body` variable. It conatins a string
            representation of the message payload in the format specified by the
            `output_payload_format` field. If the `input_payload_format` field
            is not set, the `body` variable contains the same message payload
            bytes that were published. Additionally, the following CEL extension
            functions are provided for use in this CEL expression: -
            toBase64Url: map.toBase64Url() -> string - Converts a CelValue to a
            base64url encoded string - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() ->
            string - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string - merge:
            map1.merge(map2) -> map3 - Merges the passed CEL map with the
            existing CEL map the function is applied to. - If the same key
            exists in both maps, if the key's value is type map both maps are
            merged else the value from the passed map is used. - denormalize:
            map.denormalize() -> map - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every
            value of type map or key in the map is expanded to return a single
            level map. - The resulting keys are "." separated indices of the map
            keys. - For example: { "a": 1, "b": { "c": 2, "d": 3 } "e": [4, 5] }
            .denormalize() -> { "a": 1, "b.c": 2, "b.d": 3, "e.0": 4, "e.1": 5 }
            - setField: map.setField(key, value) -> message - Sets the field of
            the message with the given key to the given value. - If the field is
            not present it will be added. - If the field is present it will be
            overwritten. - The key can be a dot separated path to set a field in
            a nested message. - Key must be of type string. - Value may be any
            valid type. - removeFields: map.removeFields([key1, key2, ...]) ->
            message - Removes the fields of the map with the given keys. - The
            keys can be a dot separated path to remove a field in a nested
            message. - If a key is not found it will be ignored. - Keys must be
            of type string. - toMap: [map1, map2, ...].toMap() -> map - Converts
            a CEL list of CEL maps to a single CEL map -
            toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:
            message.toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat() -> map - Converts a
            message to the corresponding structure of JSON format for
            CloudEvents. - It converts `data` to destination payload format
            specified in `output_payload_format`. If `output_payload_format` is
            not set, the data will remain unchanged. - It also sets the
            corresponding datacontenttype of the CloudEvent, as indicated by
            `output_payload_format`. If no `output_payload_format` is set it
            will use the value of the "datacontenttype" attribute on the
            CloudEvent if present, else remove "datacontenttype" attribute. -
            This function expects that the content of the message will adhere to
            the standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn't then this function
            will fail. - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
            representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data to a JSON
            string it can be chained with the toJsonString function. The
            Pipeline expects that the message it receives adheres to the
            standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn't then the outgoing message
            request may fail with a persistent error.

            the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the function is applied
            to. - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key's value is
            type map both maps are merged else the value from the passed map is
            used. - denormalize: map.denormalize() -> map - Denormalizes a CEL
            map such that every value of type map or key in the map is expanded
            to return a single level map. - The resulting keys are "." separated
            indices of the map keys. - For example: { "a": 1, "b": { "c": 2,

            message - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
            given value. - If the field is not present it will be added. - If
            the field is present it will be overwritten. - The key can be a dot
            separated path to set a field in a nested message. - Key must be of

            path to remove a field in a nested message. - If a key is not found
            it will be ignored. - Keys must be of type string. - toMap: [map1,
            map2, ...].toMap() -> map - Converts a CEL list of CEL maps to a

            Converts the message data to the destination payload format
            specified in Pipeline.Destination.output_payload_format - This
            function is meant to be applied to the message.data field. - If the
            destination payload format is not set, the function will return the
            message data unchanged. - toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:

            the CloudEvent, as indicated by
            Pipeline.Destination.output_payload_format. If no
            output_payload_format is set it will use the existing

    Policy:
      id: Policy
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:

      type: object
      properties:
        version:
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

    AuditConfig:
      id: AuditConfig
      description: >-
        Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration
        determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if
        any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
        AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
        specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
        service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and
        the exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy
        with multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service":
        "allServices", "audit_log_configs": [ { "log_type": "DATA_READ",
        "exempted_members": [ "user:jose@example.com" ] }, { "log_type":

        "DATA_READ" }, { "log_type": "DATA_WRITE", "exempted_members": [
        "user:aliya@example.com" ] } ] } ] } For sampleservice, this policy
        enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ logging. It also exempts
        `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and `aliya@example.com` from
        DATA_WRITE logging.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
