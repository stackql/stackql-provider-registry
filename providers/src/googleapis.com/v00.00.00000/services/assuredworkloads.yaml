        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
