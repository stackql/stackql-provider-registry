        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

            The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
            service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP
            mapping, the `name` should be a resource name ending with
            `operations/{unique_id}`.

          type: boolean
          description: >-
            If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in
            progress. If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error`
            or `response` is available.
        response:
          type: object
          description: >-
            The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original
            method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the response is
            `google.protobuf.Empty`. If the original method is standard
            `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For
            other methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`,
            where `Xxx` is the original method name. For example, if the
            original method name is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type
            is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

            typically contains progress information and common metadata such as
            create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any
            method that returns a long-running operation should document the
            metadata type, if any.
