          enumDescriptions:
            - Unknown restriction type.
            - Allow the use all of all gcp products, irrespective of the compliance posture. This effectively removes gcp.restrictServiceUsage OrgPolicy on the AssuredWorkloads Folder.
            - Based on Workload's compliance regime, allowed list changes. See - https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/supported-products for the list of supported resources.
            - Similar to ALLOW_COMPLIANT_RESOURCES but adds the list of compliant resources to the existing list of resources. Effective org-policy of the Folder is considered to ensure there is no disruption to the existing customer workflows.
