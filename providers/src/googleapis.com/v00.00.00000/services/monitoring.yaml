The buckets can be in a linear sequence, an exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly. BucketOptions does not include the number of values in each bucket.A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are finite.'

        unit:
          description: 'The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the value_type is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of the stored metric values.Different systems might scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of 0.02kBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523kBy might be displayed as 3.5MBy). However, if the unit is kBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it might be displayed.If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (https://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d day 1 dimensionlessPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples, kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ; Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | "%" ) [ Annotation ] | Annotation | "1" ; Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples, {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as 1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean "5 new users). Alternatively, "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric value of 5.3 would mean "5300 page views per day"). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100, and a metric value 3 means "3 percent"). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value 0.03 means "3 percent").'

      description: 'Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example "the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster". This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

The start time must be specified, must be earlier than the end time, and should be no older than the data retention period for the metric. Writes: A closed time interval. It extends from the start time to the end time, and includes both: [startTime, endTime]. Valid time intervals depend on the MetricKind (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.metricDescriptors#MetricKind) of the metric value. The end time must not be earlier than the start time, and the end time must not be more than 25 hours in the past or more than five minutes in the future. For GAUGE metrics, the startTime value is technically optional; if no value is specified, the start time defaults to the value of the end time, and the interval represents a single point in time. If both start and end times are specified, they must be identical. Such an interval is valid only for GAUGE metrics, which are point-in-time measurements. The end time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For DELTA metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying contiguous and non-overlapping intervals. For DELTA metrics, the start time of the next interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. For CUMULATIVE metrics, the start time and end time must specify a non-zero interval, with subsequent points specifying the same start time and increasing end times, until an event resets the cumulative value to zero and sets a new start time for the following points. The new start time must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval. The start time of a new interval must be at least a millisecond after the end time of the previous interval because intervals are closed.

The parentName field identifies an optional parent for each group. If a group has a parent, then the only monitored resources available to be matched by the group''s filter are the resources contained in the parent group. In other words, a group contains the monitored resources that match its filter and the filters of all the group''s ancestors. A group without a parent can contain any monitored resource.For example, consider an infrastructure running a set of instances with two user-defined tags: "environment" and "role". A parent group has a filter, environment="production". A child of that parent group has a filter, role="transcoder". The parent group contains all instances in the production environment, regardless of their roles. The child group contains instances that have the transcoder role and are in the production environment.The monitored resources contained in a group can change at any moment, depending on what resources exist and what filters are associated with the group and its ancestors.'

The value of performance always falls into the range 0 <= performance <= 1.
