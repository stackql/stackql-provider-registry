            if the bindings grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com,

            etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in
            the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to
            getIamPolicy, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to setIamPolicy to ensure that their change will be applied
            to the same version of the policy.Important: If you use IAM
            Conditions, you must include the etag field whenever you call
            setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the
            conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.

            Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation
            that affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This
            requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy
            that includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role
            binding to a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy
            Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
            policy that includes conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions,
            you must include the etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If
            you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3
            policy with a version 1 policy, and all of the conditions in the
            version 3 policy are lost.If a policy does not include any
            conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version
            or leave the field unset.To learn which resources support conditions
            in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation

        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of
        bindings. A binding binds one or more members, or principals, to a
        single role. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of
        permissions; each role can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role.For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also
        specify a condition, which is a logical expression that allows access to
        a resource only if the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
        constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.
        To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see

            the fraction of total workers in the cluster from this instance
            group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2, and secondary
            workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary
            workers for each secondary worker.The cluster may not reach the
            specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
            autoscaling settings. For example, if max_instances for secondary

            can also be out of balance when created.If weight is not set on any

            group. If weight is set for one group only, the cluster will default
            to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set only
            on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no
            secondary workers.

        Instantiates a template and begins execution.This method is equivalent
        to executing the sequence CreateWorkflowTemplate,
        InstantiateWorkflowTemplate, DeleteWorkflowTemplate.The returned
        Operation can be used to track execution of workflow by polling
        operations.get. The Operation will complete when entire workflow is
        finished.The running workflow can be aborted via operations.cancel. This
        will cause any inflight jobs to be cancelled and workflow-owned clusters
        to be deleted.The Operation.metadata will be WorkflowMetadata
        (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/reference/rpc/google.cloud.dataproc.v1#workflowmetadata).
        Also see Using WorkflowMetadata
        (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/workflows/debugging#using_workflowmetadata).On
        successful completion, Operation.response will be Empty.
