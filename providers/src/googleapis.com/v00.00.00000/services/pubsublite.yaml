        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

    post:
      description: >-
        Performs an out-of-band seek for a subscription to a specified target,
        which may be timestamps or named positions within the message backlog.
        Seek translates these targets to cursors for each partition and
        orchestrates subscribers to start consuming messages from these seek
        cursors. If an operation is returned, the seek has been registered and
        subscribers will eventually receive messages from the seek cursors (i.e.
        eventual consistency), as long as they are using a minimum supported
        client library version and not a system that tracks cursors
        independently of Pub/Sub Lite (e.g. Apache Beam, Dataflow, Spark). The
        seek operation will fail for unsupported clients. If clients would like
        to know when subscribers react to the seek (or not), they can poll the
        operation. The seek operation will succeed and complete once subscribers
        are ready to receive messages from the seek cursors for all partitions
        of the topic. This means that the seek operation will not complete until
        all subscribers come online. If the previous seek operation has not yet
        completed, it will be aborted and the new invocation of seek will
        supersede it.
