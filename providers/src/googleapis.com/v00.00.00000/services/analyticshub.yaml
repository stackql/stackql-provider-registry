            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you

      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

        retryPolicy:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/RetryPolicy'
          description: >-
            Optional. A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message
            delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy
            is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as
            soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be
            triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a
            given message.
        ackDeadlineSeconds:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            Optional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis)
            Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before
            resending the message. In the interval after the message is
            delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be
            _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be
            redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this
            value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override
            this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the
            corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the
            `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming
            pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
            maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
            If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For
            push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
            for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never
            acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually
            redeliver the message.
