        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work

        Update spec. The following fields in the spec can be updated: *
        display_name * source_uri * lint_response * attributes * contents *
        spec_type In case of an OAS spec, updating spec contents can lead to: 1.
        Creation, deletion and update of operations. 2. Creation, deletion and
        update of definitions. 3. Update of other info parsed out from the new
        spec. In case of contents or source_uri being present in update mask,
        spec_type must also be present. Also, spec_type can not be present in
        update mask if contents or source_uri is not present. The update_mask
        should be used to specify the fields being updated.
