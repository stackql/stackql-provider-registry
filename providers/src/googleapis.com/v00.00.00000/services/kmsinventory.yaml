        A CryptoKeyVersion represents an individual cryptographic key, and the
        associated key material. An ENABLED version can be used for
        cryptographic operations. For security reasons, the raw cryptographic
        key material represented by a CryptoKeyVersion can never be viewed or
        exported. It can only be used to encrypt, decrypt, or sign data when an
        authorized user or application invokes Cloud KMS.
