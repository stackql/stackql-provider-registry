The schedule can be either of the following types: * [Crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) * English-like [schedule](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules) As a general rule, execution `n + 1` of a job will not begin until execution `n` has finished. Cloud Scheduler will never allow two simultaneously outstanding executions. For example, this implies that if the `n+1`th execution is scheduled to run at 16:00 but the `n`th execution takes until 16:15, the `n+1`th execution will not start until `16:15`. A scheduled start time will be delayed if the previous execution has not ended when its scheduled time occurs. If retry_count > 0 and a job attempt fails, the job will be tried a total of retry_count times, with exponential backoff, until the next scheduled start time. If retry_count is 0, a job attempt will not be retried if it fails. Instead the Cloud Scheduler system will wait for the next scheduled execution time. Setting retry_count to 0 does not prevent failed jobs from running according to schedule after the failure.'

Some HTTP request headers are ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that are ignored or replaced is below: * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Scheduler and derived from uri. * `Content-Length`: This will be computed by Cloud Scheduler. * `User-Agent`: This will be set to `"Google-Cloud-Scheduler"`. * `X-Google-*`: Google internal use only. * `X-AppEngine-*`: Google internal use only. * `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true. * `X-CloudScheduler-JobName`: This header will contain the job name. * `X-CloudScheduler-ScheduleTime`: For Cloud Scheduler jobs specified in the unix-cron format, this header will contain the job schedule time in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format. If the job has a body and the following headers are not set by the user, Cloud Scheduler sets default values: * `Content-Type`: This will be set to `"application/octet-stream"`. You can override this default by explicitly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when creating the job. For example, you can set `Content-Type` to `"application/json"`.
