    GrpcRouteFaultInjectionPolicy:
      description: The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to destination service failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a destination, delays can be introduced on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the destination service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by for a percentage of requests.

          type: string
          description: '`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'

          description: 'Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
          type: array
      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or ''-'', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames "*.foo.bar.com" and "*.bar.com" to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with "*.bar.com" or both with "bar.com".

The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.example.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or ''-'', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames "*.foo.bar.com" and "*.bar.com" to be associated with the same Mesh (or Gateways under the same scope), it is not possible to associate two routes both with "*.bar.com" or both with "bar.com".'
