The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. `foo.example.com`) or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`). Note that as per RFC1035 and RFC1123, a label must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or ''-'', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for routes for the hostnames `*.foo.bar.com` and `*.bar.com` to be associated with the same route, it is not possible to associate two routes both with `*.bar.com` or both with `bar.com`. If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must use the channel URI with the port to match this rule (i.e. "xds:///service:123"), otherwise they must supply the URI without a port (i.e. "xds:///service").'

A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'
