            Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a
            unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server
            will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.
            The server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the
            first request. For example, consider a situation where you make an
            initial request and the request times out. If you make the request
            again with the same request ID, the server can check if original
            operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will
            ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
            creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID
            with the exception that zero UUID is not supported

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
