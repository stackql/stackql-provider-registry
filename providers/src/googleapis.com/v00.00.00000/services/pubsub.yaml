        deadLetterPolicy:
          description: A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is disabled. The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscriptions's parent project (i.e., service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/DeadLetterPolicy'
        expirationPolicy:
          description: A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing operations on the subscription. If `expiration_policy` is not set, a *default policy* with `ttl` of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for `expiration_policy.ttl` is 1 day. If `expiration_policy` is set, but `expiration_policy.ttl` is not set, the subscription never expires.

        detached:
          description: Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its topic. Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from their topic and don't retain any backlog. `Pull` and `StreamingPull` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.
          type: boolean
        retainAckedMessages:
          description: Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true, then messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the `message_retention_duration` window. This must be true if you would like to [`Seek` to a timestamp] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time) in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
          type: boolean
        messageRetentionDuration:
          description: How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is published. If `retain_acked_messages` is true, then this also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a `Seek` can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than 10 minutes.

          $ref: '#/components/schemas/PushConfig'
        name:
          description: Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the format `"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"`. `{subscription}` must start with a letter, and contain only letters (`[A-Za-z]`), numbers (`[0-9]`), dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), tildes (`~`), plus (`+`) or percent signs (`%`). It must be between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not start with `"goog"`.
          type: string
        filter:
          type: string
          description: An expression written in the Pub/Sub [filter language](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering). If non-empty, then only `PubsubMessage`s whose `attributes` field matches the filter are delivered on this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered out.
        ackDeadlineSeconds:
          format: int32
          type: integer
          description: The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message. In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
        topic:
          type: string
          description: Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription is receiving messages. Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`. The value of this field will be `_deleted-topic_` if the topic has been deleted.
        topicMessageRetentionDuration:
          format: google-duration
          type: string
          readOnly: true
          description: Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a message is retained after it is published to the subscription's topic. If this field is set, messages published to the subscription's topic in the last `topic_message_retention_duration` are always available to subscribers. See the `message_retention_duration` field in `Topic`. This field is set only in responses from the server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
        retryPolicy:
          description: A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription. If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message.
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/RetryPolicy'
        enableExactlyOnceDelivery:
          type: boolean
          description: 'If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery of a message with a given value of `message_id` on this subscription: * The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the message''s acknowledgement deadline expires. * An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber. Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message when `enable_exactly_once_delivery` is true if the message was published multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have distinct `message_id` values.'
      description: A subscription resource. If none of `push_config` or `bigquery_config` is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set.

    Snapshot:
      type: object
      description: A snapshot resource. Snapshots are used in [Seek](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview) operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.

        expireTime:
          description: The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time. A newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at creation by the existing backlog in the source subscription. Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is `7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)`. For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked message is 3 days old. If a snapshot is created from this subscription, the snapshot -- which will always capture this 3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot exists -- will expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after creation.

          description: Required. The push configuration for future deliveries. An empty `pushConfig` indicates that the Pub/Sub system should stop pushing messages from the given subscription and allow messages to be pulled and acknowledged - effectively pausing the subscription if `Pull` or `StreamingPull` is not called.

          description: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`. Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
        etag:
          description: '`etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'

        version:
          type: integer
          format: int32
          description: 'Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).'
      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

          description: Required. The new ack deadline with respect to the time this request was sent to the Pub/Sub system. For example, if the value is 10, the new ack deadline will expire 10 seconds after the `ModifyAckDeadline` call was made. Specifying zero might immediately make the message available for delivery to another subscriber client. This typically results in an increase in the rate of message redeliveries (that is, duplicates). The minimum deadline you can specify is 0 seconds. The maximum deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot would expire in less than 1 hour -- then `FAILED_PRECONDITION` is returned. See also the `Snapshot.expire_time` field. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
