If not present during the `CreateSubscription` call, it will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make such call. If not present in a `ModifyPushConfig` call, its value will not be changed. `GetSubscription` calls will always return a valid version, even if the subscription was created without this attribute. The only supported values for the `x-goog-version` attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.

In the interval after the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it is considered to be _outstanding_. During that time period, the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort basis). For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call `ModifyAckDeadline` with the corresponding `ack_id` if using non-streaming pull or send the `ack_id` in a `StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest` if using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used. For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint. If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.

    Policy:
      id: Policy
      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

If the backlog in the subscription is too old -- and the resulting snapshot would expire in less than 1 hour -- then `FAILED_PRECONDITION` is returned. See also the `Snapshot.expire_time` field. If the name is not provided in the request, the server will assign a random name for this snapshot on the same project as the subscription, conforming to the [resource name format] (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names). The generated name is populated in the returned Snapshot object. Note that for REST API requests, you must specify a name in the request.
