        Specification message containing the config for this SliceSpec. When
        `kind` is selected as `value` and/or `range`, only a single slice will
        be computed. When `all_values` is present, a separate slice will be
        computed for each possible label/value for the corresponding key in
        `config`. Examples, with feature zip_code with values 12345, 23334,
        88888 and feature country with values "US", "Canada", "Mexico" in the
        dataset: Example 1: { "zip_code": { "value": { "float_value": 12345.0 }
        } } A single slice for any data with zip_code 12345 in the dataset.
        Example 2: { "zip_code": { "range": { "low": 12345, "high": 20000 } } }
        A single slice containing data where the zip_codes between 12345 and
        20000 For this example, data with the zip_code of 12345 will be in this
        slice. Example 3: { "zip_code": { "range": { "low": 10000, "high": 20000
        } }, "country": { "value": { "string_value": "US" } } } A single slice
        containing data where the zip_codes between 10000 and 20000 has the
        country "US". For this example, data with the zip_code of 12345 and
        country "US" will be in this slice. Example 4: { "country":
        {"all_values": { "value": true } } } Three slices are computed, one for
        each unique country in the dataset. Example 5: { "country": {
        "all_values": { "value": true } }, "zip_code": { "value": {
        "float_value": 12345.0 } } } Three slices are computed, one for each
        unique country in the dataset where the zip_code is also 12345. For this
        example, data with zip_code 12345 and country "US" will be in one slice,
        zip_code 12345 and country "Canada" in another slice, and zip_code 12345

            predict only one score, there is only one attibution that explains
            the predicted output. For Models that predict multiple outputs, such
            as multiclass Models that predict multiple classes, each element
            explains one specific item. Attribution.output_index can be used to
            identify which output this attribution is explaining. By default, we
            provide Shapley values for the predicted class. However, you can
            configure the explanation request to generate Shapley values for any
            other classes too. For example, if a model predicts a probability of
            `0.4` for approving a loan application, the model's decision is to
            reject the application since `p(reject) = 0.6 > p(approve) = 0.4`,
            and the default Shapley values would be computed for rejection
            decision and not approval, even though the latter might be the
            positive class. If users set ExplanationParameters.top_k, the
            attributions are sorted by instance_output_value in descending
            order. If ExplanationParameters.output_indices is specified, the
            attributions are stored by Attribution.output_index in the same
            order as they appear in the output_indices.

              Too Many Requests
            - >-
              The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
              non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
              guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
              `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just
              the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at
              a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set
              fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write
              sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
              retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For
              example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
              `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should
              not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
              Mapping: 400 Bad Request
            - >-
              The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
              such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
              guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
            - >-
              The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
              indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.
              For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
              if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1],
              but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an
              offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
              using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so
              that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for
              an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP

            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM

        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

          description: >-
            Each "stopping rule" in this proto specifies an "if" condition.
            Before Vizier would generate a new suggestion, it first checks each
            specified stopping rule, from top to bottom in this list. Note that
            the first few rules (e.g. minimum_runtime_constraint,
            min_num_trials) will prevent other stopping rules from being
            evaluated until they are met. For example, setting
            `min_num_trials=5` and `always_stop_after= 1 hour` means that the
            Study will ONLY stop after it has 5 COMPLETED trials, even if more
            than an hour has passed since its creation. It follows the first
            applicable rule (whose "if" condition is satisfied) to make a
            stopping decision. If none of the specified rules are applicable,
            then Vizier decides that the study should not stop. If Vizier
            decides that the study should stop, the study enters STOPPING state
            (or STOPPING_ASAP if should_stop_asap = true). IMPORTANT: The
            automatic study state transition happens precisely as described
            above; that is, deleting trials or updating StudyConfig NEVER
            automatically moves the study state back to ACTIVE. If you want to
            _resume_ a Study that was stopped, 1) change the stopping conditions
            if necessary, 2) activate the study, and then 3) ask for
            suggestions. If the specified time or duration has not passed, do
            not stop the study.

              Cosine Distance. Defined as 1 - cosine similarity. We strongly
              suggest using DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE + UNIT_L2_NORM instead of
              COSINE distance. Our algorithms have been more optimized for
              DOT_PRODUCT distance which, when combined with UNIT_L2_NORM, is
              mathematically equivalent to COSINE distance and results in the
              same ranking.

            changed) the DeployedIndex may be asynchronously updated in the
            background to reflect these changes. If this timestamp's value is at
            least the Index.update_time of the original Index, it means that
            this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this
            timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex
            already contains (and which it does not), one must list the
            operations that are running on the original Index. Only the
            successfully completed Operations with update_time equal or before
            this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.

        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }

        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes
        how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will
        continue to work unchanged.

          type: array
          description: >-
            Optional. This allows you to specify the "context" for a Trial; a
            context is a slice (a subspace) of the search space. Typical uses
            for contexts: 1) You are using Vizier to tune a server for best
            performance, but there's a strong weekly cycle. The context
            specifies the day-of-week. This allows Tuesday to generalize from
            Wednesday without assuming that everything is identical. 2) Imagine
            you're optimizing some medical treatment for people. As they walk in
            the door, you know certain facts about them (e.g. sex, weight,
            height, blood-pressure). Put that information in the context, and
            Vizier will adapt its suggestions to the patient. 3) You want to do
            a fair A/B test efficiently. Specify the "A" and "B" conditions as
            contexts, and Vizier will generalize between "A" and "B" conditions.
            If they are similar, this will allow Vizier to converge to the
            optimum faster than if "A" and "B" were separate Studies. NOTE: You
            can also enter contexts as REQUESTED Trials, e.g. via the
            CreateTrial() RPC; that's the asynchronous option where you don't
            need a close association between contexts and suggestions. NOTE: All
            the Parameters you set in a context MUST be defined in the Study.
            NOTE: You must supply 0 or $suggestion_count contexts. If you don't
            supply any contexts, Vizier will make suggestions from the full
            search space specified in the StudySpec; if you supply a full set of
            context, each suggestion will match the corresponding context. NOTE:
            A Context with no features set matches anything, and allows
            suggestions from the full search space. NOTE: Contexts MUST lie
            within the search space specified in the StudySpec. It's an error if
            they don't. NOTE: Contexts preferentially match ACTIVE then
            REQUESTED trials before new suggestions are generated. NOTE:
            Generation of suggestions involves a match between a Context and
            (optionally) a REQUESTED trial; if that match is not fully
            specified, a suggestion will be geneated in the merged subspace.

        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...

        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return

            variable expansion, which does not use parentheses. If a variable
            cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string is used
            unchanged. To avoid variable expansion, you can escape this syntax

            After the container starts running, code running in the container
            can read these environment variables. Additionally, the command and
            args fields can reference these variables. Later entries in this
            list can also reference earlier entries. For example, the following
            example sets the variable `VAR_2` to have the value `foo bar`:
            ```json [ { "name": "VAR_1", "value": "foo" }, { "name": "VAR_2",
            "value": "$(VAR_1) bar" } ] ``` If you switch the order of the
            variables in the example, then the expansion does not occur. This
            field corresponds to the `env` field of the Kubernetes Containers
            [v1 core

            If further model training ceases to provide any improvements, it
            will stop without using the full budget and the
            metadata.successfulStopReason will be `model-converged`. Note,
            node_hour = actual_hour * number_of_nodes_involved. For modelType
            `cloud`(default), the budget must be between 8,000 and 800,000 milli
            node hours, inclusive. The default value is 192,000 which represents
            one day in wall time, considering 8 nodes are used. For model types
            `mobile-tf-low-latency-1`, `mobile-tf-versatile-1`,
            `mobile-tf-high-accuracy-1`, the training budget must be between
            1,000 and 100,000 milli node hours, inclusive. The default value is
            24,000 which represents one day in wall time on a single node that
            is used.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at

        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the

        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at

        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the

        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified

        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        the cancellation succeeded or whether the job completed despite
        cancellation. On successful cancellation, the HyperparameterTuningJob is
        not deleted; instead it becomes a job with a
        HyperparameterTuningJob.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
        corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and HyperparameterTuningJob.state is
        set to `CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Cancels a NasJob. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the NasJob. The
        server makes a best effort to cancel the job, but success is not
        guaranteed. Clients can use JobService.GetNasJob or other methods to
        check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the job completed
        despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the NasJob is not
        deleted; instead it becomes a job with a NasJob.error value with a
        google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and
        NasJob.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Imports Feature values into the Featurestore from a source storage. The

        operations after the operation is marked as successfully done. If an

        the caller can cause inconsistency. - Source data for import contains
        multiple distinct Feature values for the same entity ID and timestamp. -
        Source is modified during an import. This includes adding, updating, or
        removing source data and/or metadata. Examples of updating metadata
        include but are not limited to changing storage location, storage class,
        or retention policy. - Online serving cluster is under-provisioned.

        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Cancels a CustomJob. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the CustomJob.
        The server makes a best effort to cancel the job, but success is not
        guaranteed. Clients can use JobService.GetCustomJob or other methods to
        check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the job completed
        despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the CustomJob is not
        deleted; instead it becomes a job with a CustomJob.error value with a
        google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`, and
        CustomJob.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Cancels a TuningJob. Starts asynchronous cancellation on the TuningJob.
        The server makes a best effort to cancel the job, but success is not
        guaranteed. Clients can use GenAiTuningService.GetTuningJob or other
        methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the job
        completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the
        TuningJob is not deleted; instead it becomes a job with a
        TuningJob.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1, corresponding
        to `Code.CANCELLED`, and TuningJob.state is set to `CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Waits until the specified long-running operation is done or reaches at
        most a specified timeout, returning the latest state. If the operation
        is already done, the latest state is immediately returned. If the
        timeout specified is greater than the default HTTP/RPC timeout, the
        HTTP/RPC timeout is used. If the server does not support this method, it
        returns `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Note that this method is on a
        best-effort basis. It may return the latest state before the specified
        timeout (including immediately), meaning even an immediate response is
        no guarantee that the operation is done.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
