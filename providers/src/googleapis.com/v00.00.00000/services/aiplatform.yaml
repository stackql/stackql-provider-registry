    GoogleIamV1Policy:
      description: 'An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'')", } } ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp(''2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z'') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).'

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.'

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.'

For Models that predict multiple outputs, such as multiclass Models that predict multiple classes, each element explains one specific item. Attribution.output_index can be used to identify which output this attribution is explaining. The baselineOutputValue, instanceOutputValue and featureAttributions fields are averaged over the test data. NOTE: Currently AutoML tabular classification Models produce only one attribution, which averages attributions over all the classes it predicts. Attribution.approximation_error is not populated.'

      description: 'Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor''s `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn''t have information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ...

For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request'
            - 'The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict'
            - 'The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done.
