        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc

        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes

            Identifier. The name of the topic. The `topic` segment is used when
            connecting directly to the cluster. Structured like:

            Required. The number of partitions this topic has. The partition
            count can only be increased, not decreased. Please note that if
            partitions are increased for a topic that has a key, the
            partitioning logic or the ordering of the messages will be affected.

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        `1`, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
