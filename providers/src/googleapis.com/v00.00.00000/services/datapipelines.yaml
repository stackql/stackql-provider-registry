            - The pipeline is paused. This is a non-terminal state. When the pipeline is paused, it will hold processing jobs, but can be resumed later. For a batch pipeline, this means pausing the scheduler job. For a streaming pipeline, creating a job snapshot to resume from will give the same effect.
