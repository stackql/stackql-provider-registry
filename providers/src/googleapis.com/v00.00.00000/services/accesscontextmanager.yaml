  title: Access Context Manager API
  description: >-
    An API for setting attribute based access control to requests to Google
    Cloud services. *Warning:* Do not mix *v1alpha* and *v1* API usage in the
    same access policy. The v1alpha API supports new Access Context Manager
    features, which may have different attributes or behaviors that are not
    supported by v1. The practice of mixed API usage within a policy may result
    in the inability to update that policy, including any access levels or
    service perimeters belonging to it. It is not recommended to use both v1 and
    v1alpha for modifying policies with critical service perimeters.
    Modifications using v1alpha should be limited to policies with
    non-production/non-critical service perimeters.

        `AccessPolicy` is a container for `AccessLevels` (which define the
        necessary attributes to use Google Cloud services) and
        `ServicePerimeters` (which define regions of services able to freely
        pass data within a perimeter). An access policy is globally visible
        within an organization, and the restrictions it specifies apply to all
        projects within an organization.

        scopes:

          description: >-
            The scopes of the AccessPolicy. Scopes define which resources a
            policy can restrict and where its resources can be referenced. For
            example, policy A with `scopes=["folders/123"]` has the following
            behavior: - ServicePerimeter can only restrict projects within
            `folders/123`. - ServicePerimeter within policy A can only reference
            access levels defined within policy A. - Only one policy can include
            a given scope; thus, attempting to create a second policy which
            includes `folders/123` will result in an error. If no scopes are
            provided, then any resource within the organization can be
            restricted. Scopes cannot be modified after a policy is created.
            Policies can only have a single scope. Format: list of

            `AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_TO`: Allows the organizations listed in the
            `orgs` field to evaluate the traffic in this organization. For the
            authorization relationship to take effect, all of the organizations
            must authorize and specify the appropriate relationship direction.

    Policy:
      id: Policy
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
        "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
        "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com",
        "domain:google.com",
        "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, {
        "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
        "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
        "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
        "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
        "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
        members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
        domain:google.com -
        serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:

      properties:
        version:
          type: integer
          format: int32
          description: >-
            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        etag:
          type: string
          format: byte
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
        bindings:
          description: >-
            Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when
            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            value will be rejected. Requests for policies with any conditional
            role bindings must specify version 3. Policies with no conditional
            role bindings may specify any valid value or leave the field unset.
            The policy in the response might use the policy version that you
            specified, or it might use a lower policy version. For example, if

    EgressPolicy:
      description: >-
        Policy for egress from perimeter. EgressPolicies match requests based on
        `egress_from` and `egress_to` stanzas. For an EgressPolicy to match,
        both `egress_from` and `egress_to` stanzas must be matched. If an
        EgressPolicy matches a request, the request is allowed to span the
        ServicePerimeter boundary. For example, an EgressPolicy can be used to
        allow VMs on networks within the ServicePerimeter to access a defined
        set of projects outside the perimeter in certain contexts (e.g. to read
        data from a Cloud Storage bucket or query against a BigQuery dataset).
        EgressPolicies are concerned with the *resources* that a request relates
        as well as the API services and API actions being used. They do not
        related to the direction of data movement. More detailed documentation
        for this concept can be found in the descriptions of EgressFrom and
        EgressTo.

        Commits the dry-run specification for all the service perimeters in an
