            The unique ID for a classification. Must be specified for case
            creation. To retrieve valid classification IDs for case creation,
            use `caseClassifications.search`. Classification IDs returned by
            `caseClassifications.search` are guaranteed to be valid for at least
            6 months. If a given classification is deactiveated, it will
            immediately stop being returned. After 6 months, `case.create`
            requests using the classification ID will fail.

      description: >-
        A Case Classification represents the topic that a case is about. It's
        very important to use accurate classifications, because they're used to
        route your cases to specialists who can help you. A classification
        always has an ID that is its unique identifier. A valid ID is required
        when creating a case.

        A Case is an object that contains the details of a support case. It
        contains fields for the time it was created, its priority, its
        classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and attachments
        that get added over time. A case is parented by a Google Cloud
        organization or project. Organizations are identified by a number, so
        the name of a case parented by an organization would look like this: ```
        organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique identifiers, an
        ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ```
        ``` projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling
        the API. To learn more about project identifiers, see
        [AIP-2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510).

        Retrieve valid classifications to use when creating a support case.
        Classifications are hierarchical. Each classification is a string
        containing all levels of the hierarchy separated by `" > "`. For
        example, `"Technical Issue > Compute > Compute Engine"`. Classification
        IDs returned by this endpoint are valid for at least six months. When a
        classification is deactivated, this endpoint immediately stops returning
        it. After six months, `case.create` requests using the classification
        will fail. EXAMPLES: cURL: ```shell curl \ --header "Authorization:
        Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
        'https://cloudsupport.googleapis.com/v2/caseClassifications:search?query=display_name:"*Compute%20Engine*"'
        ``` Python: ```python import googleapiclient.discovery supportApiService
        = googleapiclient.discovery.build( serviceName="cloudsupport",
        version="v2",
        discoveryServiceUrl=f"https://cloudsupport.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v2",
        ) request = supportApiService.caseClassifications().search(
        query='display_name:"*Compute Engine*"' ) print(request.execute()) ```
