        classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and attachments
        that get added over time. A case is parented by a Google Cloud
        organization or project. Organizations are identified by a number, so
        the name of a case parented by an organization would look like this: ```
        organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique identifiers, an
        ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ```
        ``` projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling
        the API. To learn more about project identifiers, see
        [AIP-2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510).

        very important to use accurate classifications, because they're used to
        route your cases to specialists who can help you. A classification
        always has an ID that is its unique identifier. A valid ID is required

            `caseClassifications.search` are guaranteed to be valid for at least
