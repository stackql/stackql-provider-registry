        value:
          description: 'The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -> `2.5e8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -> `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` <-> `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = ''+'' | ''-''; Significand = Digits ''.'' | [Digits] ''.'' Digits; Exponent = (''e'' | ''E'') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { ''0'' | ''1'' | ''2'' | ''3'' | ''4'' | ''5'' | ''6'' | ''7'' | ''8'' | ''9'' }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.'

In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process.

Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).

Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
          type: string
        languageCode:
          description: 'Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected to match one of the languages used in the address'' country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect default). Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".'
          type: string
        locality:
          description: 'Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address. Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.'
          type: string
        organization:
          description: Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
          type: string
        postalCode:
          description: Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
          type: string
        recipients:
          description: Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example, it might contain "care of" information.
          items:
            type: string
          type: array
        regionCode:
          description: 'Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details. Example: "CH" for Switzerland.'
          type: string
        revision:
          description: The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is the latest revision. All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
          format: int32
          type: integer
        sortingCode:
          description: Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (e.g. "CEDEX 7"), or just a number alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica), "delivery area indicator" (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (e.g. Côte d'Ivoire).
          type: string
        sublocality:
          description: Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.

You can only create configs if the RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month is a future month. If needed, you can create a config for the current month, with some restrictions. When creating a config for a future month, make sure there are no existing configs for that RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month. The following restrictions are for creating configs in the current month. * This functionality is reserved for recovering from an erroneous config, and should not be used for regular business cases. * The new config will not modify exports used with other configs. Changes to the config may be immediate, but may take up to 24 hours. * There is a limit of ten configs for any ChannelPartner or RepricingConfig.effective_invoice_month. * The contained ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig.repricing_config vaule must be different from the value used in the current config for a ChannelPartner. Possible Error Codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: If the account making the request and the account being queried are different. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: Missing or invalid required parameters in the request. Also displays if the updated config is for the current month or past months. * NOT_FOUND: The ChannelPartnerRepricingConfig specified does not exist or is not associated with the given account. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to technical issues in the backend.
