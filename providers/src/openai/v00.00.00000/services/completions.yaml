            When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return â€“ `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

            **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.

            Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

          description: |
            Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

            The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5.
        max_tokens:
          type: integer
