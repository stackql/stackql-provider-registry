      <br/> <br/>
      ### Example
      The following example uses API endpoints in the US1 deployment. Sumo Logic has several deployments that are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. For details determining your account's deployment see [API endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3011).
      The [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) can be used to create or update a Search, Scheduled Search, or Dashboard. Here is an example creating a Scheduled Search:
      1. Get the identifier of your `Personal` folder.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/personal
        ```

        Find the identifier of your `Personal` folder in the response.
        ```json
        {
            ...
            "id": "0000000006A2E86F", <----
            "name": "Personal",
            "itemType": "Folder",
            ...
        }
        ```

        You can use [getFolder](#operation/getFolder), [getAdminRecommededFolder](#operation/getAdminRecommendedFolderAsync),
        or [getGlobalFolder](#operation/getGlobalFolderAsync) endpoints to traverse the content tree and find the identifier of any
        folder you want to manage.

      2. Use the [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) to create a new Scheduled Search inside your
        `Personal` folder.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @search.json https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import
        ```

        The data file `search.json` in the above command has the following `SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition` object.
        ```json
        // file: search.json
        {
            "type": "SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition",
            "name": "demo-scheduled-search",
            "description": "Runs every hour with timerange of 15m and sends email notifications",
            "search": {
                "queryText": "\"error\" and \"warn\"",

                "viewName": "",

            },
            "searchSchedule": {
                "cronExpression": "0 0/15 * * * ? *",
                "displayableTimeRange": "-15m",
                "parseableTimeRange": {
                    "from": {
                        "relativeTime": "-15m",
                        "type": "RelativeTimeRangeBoundary"
                    },
                    "to": null,
                    "type": "BeginBoundedTimeRange"
                },
                "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles",
                "threshold": null,
                "notification": {
                    "taskType": "EmailSearchNotificationSyncDefinition",
                    "toList": [
                        "ops@acme.org"
                    ],
                    "subjectTemplate": "Search Results: {{SearchName}}",
                    "includeQuery": true,
                    "includeResultSet": true,
                    "includeHistogram": true,
                    "includeCsvAttachment": false
                },
                "muteErrorEmails": false,
                "scheduleType": "1Hour",
                "parameters": []
            }
        }
        ```

        The response of above request will have the job identifier that you can use to track the status of the import job.
        ```json
        {
            "id": "74DC17FA765C7443"
        }
        ```

      3. Use the job identifier from the import request to get the [status](#operation/getAsyncImportStatus) of the
        import job.
        ```bash
        curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import/74DC17FA765C7443/status
        ```

        If you are importing a large item, you might have to wait for the import job to finish. The following is an
        example response from a completed job.
        ```json
        {
            "status": "Success",
            "statusMessage": null,
            "error": null
        }
