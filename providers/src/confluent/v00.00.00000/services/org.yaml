      `ApiKey` objects represent access to different parts of Confluent Cloud. Some types
      of API keys represent access to a single cluster/resource such as a Kafka cluster,
      Schema Registry cluster or a ksqlDB cluster. Cloud API Keys represent access to resources within an organization
      that are not tied to a specific cluster, such as the Org API, IAM API, Metrics API or Connect API.

      The API allows you to list, create, update and delete your API Keys.

      resources (e.g., Environments, Kafka Clusters, Service Accounts, API Keys) and is tied to a billing
      agreement (including any annual commitment or support plan).

      The API allows you to list, view, and update your organizations.

      `IP Filter` objects are bindings between IP Groups and Confluent resource(s).
      For example, a binding between "CorpNet" and "Management APIs" will enforce that
      access must come from one of the CIDR blocks associated with CorpNet.
      If there are multiple IP filters bound to a resource, a request matching any of the CIDR blocks
      for any of the IP Group will allow the request.
      If there are no IP Filters for a resource, then access will be granted to requests originating
      from any IP Address.

      `Subscription` objects represent the intent of the customers to get notifications of particular types.
      A subscription is created for a particular `NotificationType` and the user will get notifications on the
      `Integrations` that are provided while creating the subscription.

      This API allows you to create, retrieve, and update subscriptions,
      as well as to view the list of all your subscriptions. You can also delete subscriptions
      with RECOMMENDED or OPTIONAL notification types. Subscriptions with REQUIRED notification types cannot be deleted.
