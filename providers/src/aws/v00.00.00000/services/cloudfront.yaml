            A complex type that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your custom origin. There are three choices:
              +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
              +  CloudFront forwards only ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
              +  CloudFront forwards ``GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST``, and ``DELETE`` requests.
              
             If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For example, you might not want users to have permissions to delete objects from your origin.
        CachePolicyId:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The unique identifier of the cache policy that is attached to this cache behavior.

             A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.
        CachedMethods:
          default:

            A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches the response to requests using the specified HTTP methods. There are two choices:
              +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET`` and ``HEAD`` requests.
              +  CloudFront caches responses to ``GET``, ``HEAD``, and ``OPTIONS`` requests.
              
             If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3 Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Request-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Origin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.
        Compress:
          default: false
          type: boolean
          description: Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true; if not, specify false.

For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             The default amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin does not add HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects. For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

          description: |-
            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Working with policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/working-with-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             If you want to include values in the cache key, use a cache policy.

             If you want to send values to the origin but not include them in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more information, see [Creating origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-origin-requests.html#origin-request-create-origin-request-policy) or [Using the managed origin request policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-origin-request-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             A ``CacheBehavior`` must include either a ``CachePolicyId`` or ``ForwardedValues``. We recommend that you use a ``CachePolicyId``.

          type: number
          description: |-
            This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use the ``MaxTTL`` field in a cache policy instead of this field. For more information, see [Creating cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html#cache-key-create-cache-policy) or [Using the managed cache policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-managed-cache-policies.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             The maximum amount of time that you want objects to stay in CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP headers such as ``Cache-Control max-age``, ``Cache-Control s-maxage``, and ``Expires`` to objects.

For more information, see [Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             You must specify ``0`` for ``MinTTL`` if you configure CloudFront to forward all headers to your origin (under ``Headers``, if you specify ``1`` for ``Quantity`` and ``*`` for ``Name``).
        OriginRequestPolicyId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The unique identifier of the origin request policy that is attached to this cache behavior.

        PathPattern:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The pattern (for example, ``images/*.jpg``) that specifies which requests to apply the behavior to. When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the requested path is compared with path patterns in the order in which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.
              You can optionally include a slash (``/``) at the beginning of the path pattern. For example, ``/images/*.jpg``. CloudFront behavior is the same with or without the leading ``/``.
              The path pattern for the default cache behavior is ``*`` and cannot be changed. If the request for an object does not match the path pattern for any cache behaviors, CloudFront applies the behavior in the default cache behavior.
             For more information, see [Path Pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesPathPattern) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

            The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern``. You can specify the following options:
              +   ``allow-all``: Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
              +   ``redirect-to-https``: If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
              +   ``https-only``: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).
              
             For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see [Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
              The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

        A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes requests.
         You must create at least as many cache behaviors (including the default cache behavior) as you have origins if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the one origin from which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two origins and only the default cache behavior, the default cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects from one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.
         For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribution, see [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
         If you don't want to specify any cache behaviors, include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element. Don't include an empty ``CacheBehavior`` element because this is invalid.
         To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribution, update the distribution configuration and include only an empty ``CacheBehaviors`` element.
         To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors, update the distribution configuration and specify all of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the updated distribution.

            The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront to return to the viewer along with the custom error page. There are a variety of reasons that you might want CloudFront to return a status code different from the status code that your origin returned to CloudFront, for example:
              +  Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and prevent the response from being returned to the viewer. If you substitute ``200``, the response typically won't be intercepted.
              +  If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify ``400`` or ``500`` as the ``ResponseCode`` for all 4xx or 5xx errors.
              +  You might want to return a ``200`` status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down.

If you want to store your objects and your custom error pages in different locations, your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the following is true:
              +  The value of ``PathPattern`` matches the path to your custom error messages. For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named ``/4xx-errors``. Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, ``/4xx-errors/*``.
              +  The value of ``TargetOriginId`` specifies the value of the ``ID`` element for the origin that contains your custom error pages.
              
             If you specify a value for ``ResponsePagePath``, you must also specify a value for ``ResponseCode``.
             We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

            The protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the origin specified by ``TargetOriginId`` when a request matches the path pattern in ``PathPattern``. You can specify the following options:
              +   ``allow-all``: Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.
              +   ``redirect-to-https``: If a viewer submits an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.
              +   ``https-only``: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).
              
             For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see [Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
              The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see [Managing Cache Expiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.

Specifying a default root object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.
             Specify only the object name, for example, ``index.html``. Don't add a ``/`` before the object name.

             For viewers and CF to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication (SNI). CF supports HTTP/3 connection migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing connection. For more information about connection migration, see [Connection Migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration) at RFC 9000.

        IPV6Enabled:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6 address for your distribution, specify ``true``. If you specify ``false``, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS response code ``NOERROR`` and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution.
             In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the ``IpAddress`` parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see [Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
             If you're using an R53AWSIntlong alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution, you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the following are true:
              +  You enable IPv6 for the distribution
              +  You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects
              
             For more information, see [Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html) in the *Developer Guide*.
             If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with R53AWSIntlong or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.

             Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query strings to the origin that is associated with this cache behavior and cache based on the query string parameters. CloudFront behavior depends on the value of ``QueryString`` and on the values that you specify for ``QueryStringCacheKeys``, if any:
             If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you don't specify any values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys``, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin and caches based on all query string parameters. Depending on how many query string parameters and values you have, this can adversely affect performance because CloudFront must forward more requests to the origin.
             If you specify true for ``QueryString`` and you specify one or more values for ``QueryStringCacheKeys``, CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to the origin, but it only caches based on the query string parameters that you specify.
             If you specify false for ``QueryString``, CloudFront doesn't forward any query string parameters to the origin, and doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

              +   ``static-ip`` - Do not specify this value unless your distribution has been enabled for this feature by the CloudFront team. If you have a use case that requires static IP addresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through the [Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home).
              
             If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``, don't set a value for this field.

      description: |-
        A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration for communicating with viewers.
         If the distribution doesn't use ``Aliases`` (also known as alternate domain names or CNAMEs)—that is, if the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as ``d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net``—set ``CloudFrontDefaultCertificate`` to ``true`` and leave all other fields empty.
         If the distribution uses ``Aliases`` (alternate domain names or CNAMEs), use the fields in this type to specify the following settings:
          +  Which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from: only viewers that support [server name indication (SNI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) (recommended), or all viewers including those that don't support SNI.
          +  To accept HTTPS connections from only viewers that support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``sni-only``. This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
          +  To accept HTTPS connections from all viewers, including those that don't support SNI, set ``SSLSupportMethod`` to ``vip``. This is not recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from CloudFront. (In CloudFormation, the field name is ``SslSupportMethod``. Note the different capitalization.)
          
          +  The minimum SSL/TLS protocol version that the distribution can use to communicate with viewers. To specify a minimum version, choose a value for ``MinimumProtocolVersion``. For more information, see [Security Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
          +  The location of the SSL/TLS certificate, [(ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) (recommended) or [(IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html). You specify the location by setting a value in one of the following fields (not both):
          +   ``ACMCertificateArn`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``AcmCertificateArn``. Note the different capitalization.)
          +   ``IAMCertificateId`` (In CloudFormation, this field name is ``IamCertificateId``. Note the different capitalization.)
          
          
         All distributions support HTTPS connections from viewers. To require viewers to use HTTPS only, or to redirect them from HTTP to HTTPS, use ``ViewerProtocolPolicy`` in the ``CacheBehavior`` or ``DefaultCacheBehavior``. To specify how CloudFront should use SSL/TLS to communicate with your custom origin, use ``CustomOriginConfig``.
         For more information, see [Using HTTPS with CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https.html) and [Using Alternate Domain Names and HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-alternate-domain-names.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
