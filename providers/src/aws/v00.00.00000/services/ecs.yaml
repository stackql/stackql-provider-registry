          description: The short name of the capacity provider.
        Weight:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            The *weight* value designates the relative percentage of the total number of tasks launched that should use the specified capacity provider. The ``weight`` value is taken into consideration after the ``base`` value, if defined, is satisfied.
             If no ``weight`` value is specified, the default value of ``0`` is used. When multiple capacity providers are specified within a capacity provider strategy, at least one of the capacity providers must have a weight value greater than zero and any capacity providers with a weight of ``0`` can't be used to place tasks. If you specify multiple capacity providers in a strategy that all have a weight of ``0``, any ``RunTask`` or ``CreateService`` actions using the capacity provider strategy will fail.
             An example scenario for using weights is defining a strategy that contains two capacity providers and both have a weight of ``1``, then when the ``base`` is satisfied, the tasks will be split evenly across the two capacity providers. Using that same logic, if you specify a weight of ``1`` for *capacityProviderA* and a weight of ``4`` for *capacityProviderB*, then for every one task that's run using *capacityProviderA*, four tasks would use *capacityProviderB*.
      additionalProperties: false
      description: |-
        The details of a capacity provider strategy. A capacity provider strategy can be set when using the ``RunTask`` or ``CreateService`` APIs or as the default capacity provider strategy for a cluster with the ``CreateCluster`` API.
         Only capacity providers that are already associated with a cluster and have an ``ACTIVE`` or ``UPDATING`` status can be used in a capacity provider strategy. The ``PutClusterCapacityProviders`` API is used to associate a capacity provider with a cluster.
         If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the capacity provider must already be created. New Auto Scaling group capacity providers can be created with the ``CreateCapacityProvider`` API operation.
         To use an FARGATElong capacity provider, specify either the ``FARGATE`` or ``FARGATE_SPOT`` capacity providers. The FARGATElong capacity providers are available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster to be used in a capacity provider strategy.

        Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace. After you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new services with Service Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added as client services in the namespace. This setting only applies to new services that set the ``enabled`` parameter to ``true`` in the ``ServiceConnectConfiguration``. You can set the namespace of each service individually in the ``ServiceConnectConfiguration`` to override this default
        parameter.
         Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

            The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMAPlong namespace that's used when you create a service and don't specify a Service Connect configuration. The namespace name can include up to 1024 characters. The name is case-sensitive. The name can't include hyphens (-), tilde (~), greater than (>), less than (<), or slash (/).
             If you enter an existing namespace name or ARN, then that namespace will be used. Any namespace type is supported. The namespace must be in this account and this AWS Region.
             If you enter a new name, a CMAPlong namespace will be created. Amazon ECS creates a CMAP namespace with the "API calls" method of instance discovery only. This instance discovery method is the "HTTP" namespace type in the CLIlong. Other types of instance discovery aren't used by Service Connect.
             If you update the cluster with an empty string ``""`` for the namespace name, the cluster configuration for Service Connect is removed. Note that the namespace will remain in CMAP and must be deleted separately.
             For more information about CMAPlong, see [Working with Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.html) in the *Developer Guide*.

        MaximumPercent:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            If a service is using the rolling update (``ECS``) deployment type, the ``maximumPercent`` parameter represents an upper limit on the number of your service's tasks that are allowed in the ``RUNNING`` or ``PENDING`` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the ``desiredCount`` (rounded down to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service is using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler and has a ``desiredCount`` of
            four tasks and a ``maximumPercent`` value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default ``maximumPercent`` value for a service using the ``REPLICA`` service scheduler is 200%.
             If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *maximum percent* value is set to the default value and is used to define the upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the ``RUNNING`` state while the container instances are in the ``DRAINING`` state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.
        MinimumHealthyPercent:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            If a service is using the rolling update (``ECS``) deployment type, the ``minimumHealthyPercent`` represents a lower limit on the number of your service's tasks that must remain in the ``RUNNING`` state during a deployment, as a percentage of the ``desiredCount`` (rounded up to the nearest integer). This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a ``desiredCount`` of four tasks and a ``minimumHealthyPercent`` of 50%,
            the service scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. 
             For services that *do not* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:
              +  A service is considered healthy if all essential containers within the tasks in the service pass their health checks.
              +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for 40 seconds after a task reaches a ``RUNNING`` state before the task is counted towards the minimum healthy percent total.
              +  If a task has one or more essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the task to reach a healthy status before counting it towards the minimum healthy percent total. A task is considered healthy when all essential containers within the task have passed their health checks. The amount of time the service scheduler can wait for is determined by the container health check settings. 
              
             For services that *do* use a load balancer, the following should be noted:
              +  If a task has no essential containers with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.
              +  If a task has an essential container with a health check defined, the service scheduler will wait for both the task to reach a healthy status and the load balancer target group health check to return a healthy status before counting the task towards the minimum healthy percent total.
              
             If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and is running tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the *minimum healthy percent* value is set to the default value and is used to define the lower limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the ``RUNNING`` state while the container instances are in the ``DRAINING`` state. If a service is using either the blue/green (``CODE_DEPLOY``) or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment types and is running tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is not used, although it is returned when describing your service.

            The type of placement strategy. The ``random`` placement strategy randomly places tasks on available candidates. The ``spread`` placement strategy spreads placement across available candidates evenly based on the ``field`` parameter. The ``binpack`` strategy places tasks on available candidates that have the least available amount of the resource that's specified with the ``field`` parameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on the instance with the least
            amount of remaining memory but still enough to run the task.

             By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition. For more information about the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation.
             Understand the following when specifying a log configuration for your containers.
              +  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon. Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.
             For tasks on FARGATElong, the supported log drivers are ``awslogs``, ``splunk``, and ``awsfirelens``.
             For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the supported log drivers are ``awslogs``, ``fluentd``, ``gelf``, ``json-file``, ``journald``, ``logentries``,``syslog``, ``splunk``, and ``awsfirelens``.
              +  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.
              +  For tasks that are hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container agent must register the available logging drivers with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS container agent configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
              +  For tasks that are on FARGATElong, because you don't have access to the underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on, any additional software needed must be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd output aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs to.

        HealthCheckGracePeriodSeconds:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only used when your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer defined and you don't specify a health check grace period value, the default value of ``0`` is used.
             If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use the ``startPeriod`` in the task definition health check parameters. For more information, see [Health check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html).
             If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.

            Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the task. If no value is specified, the tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use the [TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html) API action.
             The default is ``NONE``.
        Role:

          description: |-
            The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your service and your task definition doesn't use the ``awsvpc`` network mode. If you specify the ``role`` parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the ``loadBalancers`` parameter.
              If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the ``awsvpc`` network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don't specify a role here. For more information, see [Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
              If your specified role has a path other than ``/``, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name ``bar`` has a path of ``/foo/`` then you would specify ``/foo/bar`` as the role name.

            The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information, see [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html).
             There are two service scheduler strategies available:
              +   ``REPLICA``-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller types.
              +   ``DAEMON``-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that don't meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.
              Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the ``CODE_DEPLOY`` or ``EXTERNAL`` deployment controller types don't support the ``DAEMON`` scheduling strategy.
        ServiceConnectConfiguration:

          description: |-
            The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.
             Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect. For more information, see [Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

             The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
              +  Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
              +  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
              +  Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
              +  Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
              +  If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
              +  Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
              +  Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
        TaskDefinition:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The ``family`` and ``revision`` (``family:revision``) or full ARN of the task definition to run in your service. If a ``revision`` isn't specified, the latest ``ACTIVE`` revision is used.
             A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the ``ECS`` or ``CODE_DEPLOY`` deployment controllers.

        Cpu:

            The number of ``cpu`` units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to ``CpuShares`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--cpu-shares`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
             This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level ``cpu`` value.
              You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the [Amazon EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) detail page by 1,024.
              Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that's the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task is guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed. Moreover, each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it. If both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units.
             On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see [CPU share constraint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cpu-share-constraint) in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter isn't required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:
              +   *Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0:* Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.
              +   *Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0:* Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.
              
             On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that's described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as ``0``, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

            A list of ARNs in SSM or Amazon S3 to a credential spec (``CredSpec``) file that configures the container for Active Directory authentication. We recommend that you use this parameter instead of the ``dockerSecurityOptions``. The maximum number of ARNs is 1.
             There are two formats for each ARN.
              + credentialspecdomainless:MyARN You use credentialspecdomainless:MyARN to provide a CredSpec with an additional section for a secret in . You provide the login credentials to the domain in the secret. Each task that runs on any container instance can join different domains. You can use this format without joining the container instance to a domain. + credentialspec:MyARN You use credentialspec:MyARN to provide a CredSpec for a single domain. You must join the container instance to the domain before you start any tasks that use this task definition. 
             In both formats, replace ``MyARN`` with the ARN in SSM or Amazon S3.
             If you provide a ``credentialspecdomainless:MyARN``, the ``credspec`` must provide a ARN in ASMlong for a secret containing the username, password, and the domain to connect to. For better security, the instance isn't joined to the domain for domainless authentication. Other applications on the instance can't use the domainless credentials. You can use this parameter to run tasks on the same instance, even it the tasks need to join different domains.

However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ``ecs-init`` package. If your container instances are launched from version ``20190301`` or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ``ecs-init``. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
             For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:

            The image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. By default, images in the Docker Hub registry are available. Other repositories are specified with either ``repository-url/image:tag`` or ``repository-url/image@digest``. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed. This parameter maps to ``Image`` in the [Create a

          description: >-
            The ``links`` parameter allows containers to communicate with each other without the need for port mappings. This parameter is only supported if the network mode of a task definition is ``bridge``. The ``name:internalName`` construct is analogous to ``name:alias`` in Docker links. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. For more information about linking Docker containers, go to [Legacy container
            links](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/network/links/) in the Docker documentation. This parameter maps to ``Links`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--link`` option to [docker

             This parameter maps to ``LogConfig`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--log-driver`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see [Configure logging drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) in the Docker documentation.
              Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the [LogConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_LogConfiguration.html) data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.
              This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: ``sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'`` 
              The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ``ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS`` environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
        Memory:
          description: >-
            The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task ``memory`` value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to ``Memory`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote
            API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--memory`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
             If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional.
             If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both a container-level ``memory`` and ``memoryReservation`` value, ``memory`` must be greater than ``memoryReservation``. If you specify ``memoryReservation``, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance where the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of ``memory`` is used.
             The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 6 MiB of memory for your containers.
             The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.
          type: integer
        MemoryReservation:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the ``memory`` parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to ``MemoryReservation`` in the [Create a
            container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--memory-reservation`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
             If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of ``memory`` or ``memoryReservation`` in a container definition. If you specify both, ``memory`` must be greater than ``memoryReservation``. If you specify ``memoryReservation``, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance where the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of ``memory`` is used.
             For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a ``memoryReservation`` of 128 MiB, and a ``memory`` hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed.
             The Docker 20.10.0 or later daemon reserves a minimum of 6 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 6 MiB of memory for your containers. 
             The Docker 19.03.13-ce or earlier daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container. So, don't specify less than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.

             Windows containers can mount whole directories on the same drive as ``$env:ProgramData``. Windows containers can't mount directories on a different drive, and mount point can't be across drives.
        Name:
          description: >-
            The name of a container. If you're linking multiple containers together in a task definition, the ``name`` of one container can be entered in the ``links`` of another container to connect the containers. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. This parameter maps to ``name`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote
            API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--name`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration).
          type: string
        PortMappings:
          description: |-
            The list of port mappings for the container. Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container instance to send or receive traffic.
             For task definitions that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode, you should only specify the ``containerPort``. The ``hostPort`` can be left blank or it must be the same value as the ``containerPort``.
             Port mappings on Windows use the ``NetNAT`` gateway address rather than ``localhost``. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself. 
             This parameter maps to ``PortBindings`` in the [Create a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate) section of the [Docker Remote API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/) and the ``--publish`` option to [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). If the network mode of a task definition is set to ``none``, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to ``host``, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping.
              After a task reaches the ``RUNNING`` status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the *Network Bindings* section of a container description for a selected task in the Amazon ECS console. The assignments are also visible in the ``networkBindings`` section [DescribeTasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html) responses.

        StartTimeout:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Time duration (in seconds) to wait before giving up on resolving dependencies for a container. For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a ``COMPLETE``, ``SUCCESS``, or ``HEALTHY`` status. If a ``startTimeout`` value is specified for containerB and it doesn't reach the desired status within that time then containerA gives up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a ``STOPPED`` state.
              When the ``ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT`` container agent configuration variable is used, it's enforced independently from this start timeout value.
              For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:
              +  Linux platform version ``1.3.0`` or later.
              +  Windows platform version ``1.0.0`` or later.
              
             For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version ``1.26.0`` of the container agent to use a container start timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version ``1.26.0-1`` of the ``ecs-init`` package. If your container instances are launched from version ``20190301`` or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ``ecs-init``. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
             The valid values are 2-120 seconds.
        StopTimeout:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            Time duration (in seconds) to wait before the container is forcefully killed if it doesn't exit normally on its own.
             For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires the following platforms:
              +  Linux platform version ``1.3.0`` or later.
              +  Windows platform version ``1.0.0`` or later.
              
             The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used.
             For tasks that use the EC2 launch type, if the ``stopTimeout`` parameter isn't specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS container agent configuration variable ``ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT`` is used. If neither the ``stopTimeout`` parameter or the ``ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT`` agent configuration variable are set, then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30 seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use a container stop timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

         We don't recommend that you specify network-related ``systemControls`` parameters for multiple containers in a single task that also uses either the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode. Doing this has the following disadvantages:
          +  For tasks that use the ``awsvpc`` network mode including Fargate, if you set ``systemControls`` for any container, it applies to all containers in the task. If you set different ``systemControls`` for multiple containers in a single task, the container that's started last determines which ``systemControls`` take effect.
          +  For tasks that use the ``host`` network mode, the network namespace ``systemControls`` aren't supported.
          
         If you're setting an IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task, the following conditions apply to your system controls. For more information, see [IPC mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_definition_ipcmode).
          +  For tasks that use the ``host`` IPC mode, IPC namespace ``systemControls`` aren't supported.

    HealthCheck:
      description: |-
        The ``HealthCheck`` property specifies an object representing a container health check. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a parent image or from the image's Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the ``HEALTHCHECK`` parameter of [docker run](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).
          The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in the container image.
          If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.
         The following are notes about container health check support:
          +  Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see [Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html).
          +  Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you are using platform version 1.1.0 or greater. For more information, see [Platform Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html).
          +  Container health checks are not supported for tasks that are part of a service that is configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.

             If you use containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode, specify the exposed ports using ``containerPort``.
             If you use containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode and you specify a container port and not a host port, your container automatically receives a host port in the ephemeral port range. For more information, see ``hostPort``. Port mappings that are automatically assigned in this way do not count toward the 100 reserved ports limit of a container instance.
        ContainerPortRange:

             The following rules apply when you specify a ``containerPortRange``:
              +  You must use either the ``bridge`` network mode or the ``awsvpc`` network mode.
              +  This parameter is available for both the EC2 and FARGATElong launch types.
              +  This parameter is available for both the Linux and Windows operating systems.
              +  The container instance must have at least version 1.67.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.67.0-1 of the ``ecs-init`` package 
              +  You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per container.
              +  You do not specify a ``hostPortRange``. The value of the ``hostPortRange`` is set as follows:
              +  For containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the ``hostPortRange`` is set to the same value as the ``containerPortRange``. This is a static mapping strategy.
              +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open host ports from the default ephemeral range and passes it to docker to bind them to the container ports.
              
              +  The ``containerPortRange`` valid values are between 1 and 65535.
              +  A port can only be included in one port mapping per container.
              +  You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.
              +  The first port in the range must be less than last port in the range.
              +  Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file when you have a large number of ports.
             For more information, see [Issue #11185](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/11185) on the Github website.
             For information about how to turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker daemon config file, see [Docker daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/bootstrap_container_instance.html#bootstrap_docker_daemon) in the *Amazon ECS Developer Guide*.

        HostPort:
          type: integer
          description: |-
            The port number on the container instance to reserve for your container.
             If you specify a ``containerPortRange``, leave this field empty and the value of the ``hostPort`` is set as follows:
              +  For containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` is set to the same value as the ``containerPort``. This is a static mapping strategy.
              +  For containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, the Amazon ECS agent finds open ports on the host and automatically binds them to the container ports. This is a dynamic mapping strategy.
              
             If you use containers in a task with the ``awsvpc`` or ``host`` network mode, the ``hostPort`` can either be left blank or set to the same value as the ``containerPort``.
             If you use containers in a task with the ``bridge`` network mode, you can specify a non-reserved host port for your container port mapping, or you can omit the ``hostPort`` (or set it to ``0``) while specifying a ``containerPort`` and your container automatically receives a port in the ephemeral port range for your container instance operating system and Docker version.
             The default ephemeral port range for Docker version 1.6.0 and later is listed on the instance under ``/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range``. If this kernel parameter is unavailable, the default ephemeral port range from 49153 through 65535 (Linux) or 49152 through 65535 (Windows) is used. Do not attempt to specify a host port in the ephemeral port range as these are reserved for automatic assignment. In general, ports below 32768 are outside of the ephemeral port range.
             The default reserved ports are 22 for SSH, the Docker ports 2375 and 2376, and the Amazon ECS container agent ports 51678-51680. Any host port that was previously specified in a running task is also reserved while the task is running. That is, after a task stops, the host port is released. The current reserved ports are displayed in the ``remainingResources`` of [DescribeContainerInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContainerInstances.html) output. A container instance can have up to 100 reserved ports at a time. This number includes the default reserved ports. Automatically assigned ports aren't included in the 100 reserved ports quota.

We recommend that you set this parameter to be consistent with the protocol that your application uses. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific connection handling to the Service Connect proxy. If you set this parameter, Amazon ECS adds protocol-specific telemetry in the Amazon ECS console and CloudWatch.
             If you don't set a value for this parameter, then TCP is used. However, Amazon ECS doesn't add protocol-specific telemetry for TCP.

             Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service Connect.

             With the ``host`` and ``awsvpc`` network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the ``host`` network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the ``awsvpc`` network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings. 
              When using the ``host`` network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.
              If the network mode is ``awsvpc``, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
             If the network mode is ``host``, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used.
             For more information, see [Network settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings) in the *Docker run reference*.

             Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent and at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ``ecs-init`` package to use a proxy configuration. If your container instances are launched from the Amazon ECS optimized AMI version ``20190301`` or later, they contain the required versions of the container agent and ``ecs-init``. For more information, see [Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

For more information, see [Amazon ECS launch types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
        TaskRoleArn:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMlong role that grants containers in the task permission to call AWS APIs on your behalf. For more information, see [Amazon ECS Task Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
             IAM roles for tasks on Windows require that the ``-EnableTaskIAMRole`` option is set when you launch the Amazon ECS-optimized Windows AMI. Your containers must also run some configuration code to use the feature. For more information, see [Windows IAM roles for tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows_task_IAM_roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

              The ``host`` and ``sourcePath`` parameters aren't supported for tasks run on FARGATElong.
        PidMode:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``host`` or ``task``. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only valid value is ``task``. For example, monitoring sidecars might need ``pidMode`` to access information about other containers running in the same task.
             If ``host`` is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified the ``host`` PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance.
             If ``task`` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace.
             If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace for each container. For more information, see [PID settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid) in the *Docker run reference*.
             If the ``host`` PID mode is used, there's a heightened risk of undesired process namespace exposure. For more information, see [Docker security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/).
              This parameter is not supported for Windows containers.
               This parameter is only supported for tasks that are hosted on FARGATElong if the tasks are using platform version ``1.4.0`` or later (Linux). This isn't supported for Windows containers on Fargate.

          description: |-
            The operating system that your tasks definitions run on. A platform family is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch type. 
             When you specify a task definition in a service, this value must match the ``runtimePlatform`` value of the service.
        IpcMode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``host``, ``task``, or ``none``. If ``host`` is specified, then all containers within the tasks that specified the ``host`` IPC mode on the same container instance share the same IPC resources with the host Amazon EC2 instance. If ``task`` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same IPC resources. If ``none`` is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task
            are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see [IPC settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc) in the *Docker run reference*.
             If the ``host`` IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more information, see [Docker security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/).
             If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using ``systemControls`` for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see [System Controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
              +  For tasks that use the ``host`` IPC mode, IPC namespace related ``systemControls`` are not supported.
              +  For tasks that use the ``task`` IPC mode, IPC namespace related ``systemControls`` will apply to all containers within a task.
              
              This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks run on FARGATElong.

            The metadata that you apply to the task definition to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both of them.
             The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
              +  Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
              +  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.
              +  Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
              +  Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
              +  If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.
              +  Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
              +  Do not use ``aws:``, ``AWS:``, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.
      x-stackql-resource-name: task_definition
      description: |-
        Registers a new task definition from the supplied ``family`` and ``containerDefinitions``. Optionally, you can add data volumes to your containers with the ``volumes`` parameter. For more information about task definition parameters and defaults, see [Amazon ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_defintions.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
         You can specify a role for your task with the ``taskRoleArn`` parameter. When you specify a role for a task, its containers can then use the latest versions of the CLI or SDKs to make API requests to the AWS services that are specified in the policy that's associated with the role. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
         You can specify a Docker networking mode for the containers in your task definition with the ``networkMode`` parameter. The available network modes correspond to those described in [Network settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/network-settings) in the Docker run reference. If you specify the ``awsvpc`` network mode, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html) in the *Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.
          In the following example or examples, the Authorization header contents (``AUTHPARAMS``) must be replaced with an AWS Signature Version 4 signature. For more information, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) in the *General Reference*.
         You only need to learn how to sign HTTP requests if you intend to create them manually. When you use the [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) or one of the [SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tools/) to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you, with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you don't have to sign requests yourself.
