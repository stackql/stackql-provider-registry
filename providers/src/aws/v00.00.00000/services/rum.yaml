            This field is a map of field paths to dimension names. It defines the dimensions to associate with this metric in CloudWatch. For extended metrics, valid values for the entries in this field are the following:

        EventPattern:
          description: |-
            The pattern that defines the metric, specified as a JSON object. RUM checks events that happen in a user's session against the pattern, and events that match the pattern are sent to the metric destination.

            When you define extended metrics, the metric definition is not valid if EventPattern is omitted.

            Example event patterns:

            '{ "event_type": ["com.amazon.rum.js_error_event"], "metadata": { "browserName": [ "Chrome", "Safari" ], } }'

            '{ "event_type": ["com.amazon.rum.performance_navigation_event"], "metadata": { "browserName": [ "Chrome", "Firefox" ] }, "event_details": { "duration": [{ "numeric": [ "<", 2000 ] }] } }'

            '{ "event_type": ["com.amazon.rum.performance_navigation_event"], "metadata": { "browserName": [ "Chrome", "Safari" ], "countryCode": [ "US" ] }, "event_details": { "duration": [{ "numeric": [ ">=", 2000, "<", 8000 ] }] } }'

            If the metrics destination' is CloudWatch and the event also matches a value in DimensionKeys, then the metric is published with the specified dimensions.
