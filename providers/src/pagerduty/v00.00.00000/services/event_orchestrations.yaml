        Get a Global Orchestration's Routing Rules.

        An Orchestration Router allows you to create a set of Event Rules. The Router evaluates Events you send to this Global Orchestration against each of its rules, one at a time, and routes the event to a specific Service based on the first rule that matches. If an event doesn't match any rules, it'll be sent to service specified in as the `catch_all` or the "Unrouted" Orchestration if no service is specified.

        Get a Global Event Orchestration's Rules for Unrouted events.

        An Unrouted Orchestration allows you to create a set of Event Rules that will be evaluated against all events that don't match any rules in the Global Orchestration's Router. Events that reach the Unrouted Orchestration will never be routed to a specific Service.

        The Unrouted Orchestration evaluates Events sent to it against each of its rules, beginning with the rules in the "start" set. When a matching rule is found, it can modify and enhance the event and can route the event to another set of rules within this Unrouted Orchestration for further processing.
