        Create a new service.

        If `status` is included in the request, it must have a value of `active` when creating a new service. If a different status is required, make a second request to update the service.

        A service may represent an application, component, or team you wish to open incidents against.

        There is a limit of 25,000 services per account. If the limit is reached, the API will respond with an error. There is also a limit of 100,000 open Incidents per Service. If the limit is reached and `auto_resolve_timeout` is disabled (set to 0 or null), the `auto_resolve_timeout` property will automatically be set to  84600 (1 day).

        > ### End-of-life
        > Rulesets and Event Rules will end-of-life soon. We highly recommend that you [migrate to Event Orchestration](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/migrate-to-event-orchestration) as soon as possible so you can take advantage of the new functionality, such as improved UI, rule creation, APIs and Terraform support, advanced conditions, and rule nesting.
