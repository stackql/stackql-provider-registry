Must be greater than or equal to a billable unit of the given currency and smaller or equal to upper bounds. Each performance_goal_type has its upper bound: * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPA`, upper bound is 10000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPC`, upper bound is 1000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, upper bound is 1000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CUSTOM_ALGO`, upper bound is 1000.00 and lower bound is 0.01. Example: If set to `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, the bid price will be based on the probability that each available impression will be viewable. For example, if viewable CPM target is $2 and an impression is 40% likely to be viewable, the bid price will be $0.80 CPM (40% of $2).
