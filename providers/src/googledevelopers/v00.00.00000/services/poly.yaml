            - The asset import did not include any file that we can import (i.e. an OBJ file).
            - When generating the preview for the import, no geometry was found.
            - A problem was encountered while parsing the OBJ file. The converter makes a 'best effort' attempt to continue when encountering such issues. In some cases the resulting preview model may still be acceptable. The details can be found in the parse error message.
            - The importer was not able to import the model before the expiration time.

            - Multiple files were encountered in addition to a ZIP archive. When uploading an archive only one file is permitted.
            - Default materials are used in the model. This means that one or more faces is using default materials either because no usemtl statement was specified or because the requested material was not found due to a missing material file or bad material name. This does not cover the case of missing textures.

        orientingRotation:
          description: 'A rotation that should be applied to the object root to make it upright. More precisely, this quaternion transforms from "object space" (the space in which the object is defined) to "presentation space", a coordinate system where +Y is up, +X is right, -Z is forward. For example, if the object is the Eiffel Tower, in its local coordinate system the object might be laid out such that the base of the tower is on the YZ plane and the tip of the tower is towards positive X. In this case this quaternion would specify a rotation (of 90 degrees about the Z axis) such that in the presentation space the base of the tower is aligned with the XZ plane, and the tip of the tower lies towards +Y. This rotation is unrelated to the object''s pose in the web preview, which is just a camera position setting and is *not* reflected in this rotation. Please note: this is applicable only to the gLTF.'
