      - Query metrics from any time period (timeseries and scalar)
      - Modify tag configurations for metrics

      aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set number.

      The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and

      This API is available to all Pro and Enterprise customers.
      Usage is only accessible for [parent-level organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).

      **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.
      It is retained for 15 months.

      You can retrieve up to 24 hours of hourly usage data for multiple organizations,
      and up to two months of hourly usage data for a single organization in one request.

        Get monthly cost attribution by tag across multi-org and single root-org accounts.
        Cost Attribution data for a given month becomes available no later than the 17th of the following month.
        This API endpoint is paginated. To make sure you receive all records, check if the value of `next_record_id` is
        set in the response. If it is, make another request and pass `next_record_id` as a parameter.
        Pseudo code example:
        ```
        response := GetMonthlyCostAttribution(start_month, end_month)
        cursor := response.metadata.pagination.next_record_id
        WHILE cursor != null BEGIN
          sleep(5 seconds)  # Avoid running into rate limit
          response := GetMonthlyCostAttribution(start_month, end_month, next_record_id=cursor)
          cursor := response.metadata.pagination.next_record_id
        END
        ```
