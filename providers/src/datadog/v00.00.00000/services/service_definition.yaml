      - Query metrics from any time period (timeseries and scalar)
      - Modify tag configurations for metrics

      aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set number.

      Datadog Synthetics uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to help you ensure uptime,
      identify regional issues, and track your application performance. Datadog Synthetics tests come in
      two different flavors, [API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/)
      and [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You can use Datadog’s API to
      manage both test types programmatically.

      The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and

      This API is available to all Pro and Enterprise customers.
      Usage is only accessible for [parent-level organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).

      **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.
      It is retained for 15 months.

      You can retrieve up to 24 hours of hourly usage data for multiple organizations,
      and up to two months of hourly usage data for a single organization in one request.
