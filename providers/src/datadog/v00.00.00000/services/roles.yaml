  description: |-
    The Roles API is used to create and manage Datadog roles, what
    [global permissions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/)
    they grant, and which users belong to them.

    Permissions related to specific account assets can be granted to roles
    in the Datadog application without using this API. For example, granting
    read access on a specific log index to a role can be done in Datadog from the
    [Pipelines page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines).

      two different flavors, [API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/)
      and [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You can use Datadogâ€™s API to

      The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and

      This API is available to all Pro and Enterprise customers.
      Usage is only accessible for [parent-level organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).

      **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.
      It is retained for 15 months.

      You can retrieve up to 24 hours of hourly usage data for multiple organizations,
      and up to two months of hourly usage data for a single organization in one request.
