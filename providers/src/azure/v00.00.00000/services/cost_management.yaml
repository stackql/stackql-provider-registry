    ExportDeliveryDestination:
      description: This represents the blob storage account location where exports of costs will be delivered. There are two ways to configure the destination. The approach recommended for most customers is to specify the resourceId of the storage account. This requires a one-time registration of the account's subscription with the Microsoft.CostManagementExports resource provider in order to give Cost Management services access to the storage. When creating an export in the Azure portal this registration is performed automatically but API users may need to register the subscription explicitly (for more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services ). Another way to configure the destination is available ONLY to Partners with a Microsoft Partner Agreement plan who are global admins of their billing account. These Partners, instead of specifying the resourceId of a storage account, can specify the storage account name along with a SAS token for the account. This allows exports of costs to a storage account in any tenant. The SAS token should be created for the blob service with Service/Container/Object resource types and with Read/Write/Delete/List/Add/Create permissions (for more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/export-cost-data-storage-account-sas-key ).

      operationId: CostDetailsReport_CreateOperation
      description: This API is the replacement for all previously release Usage Details APIs. Request to generate a cost details report for the provided date range, billing period (Only enterprise customers) or Invoice Id asynchronously at a certain scope. The initial call to request a report will return a 202 with a 'Location' and 'Retry-After' header. The 'Location' header will provide the endpoint to poll to get the result of the report generation. The 'Retry-After' provides the duration to wait before polling for the generated report. A call to poll the report operation will provide a 202 response with a 'Location' header if the operation is still in progress. Once the report generation operation completes, the polling endpoint will provide a 200 response along with details on the report blob(s) that are available for download. The details on the file(s) available for download will be available in the polling response body. To Understand cost details (formerly known as usage details) fields found in files ,see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/automate/understand-usage-details-fields
