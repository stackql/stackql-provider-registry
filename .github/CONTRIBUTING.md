## Pull Requests

Please fork our repository and then raise a Pull Request against our `dev` branch.  Please add a fulsome description in the Pull Request comment.  We will attend to it and work with you as soon as possible.  

Once the PR is merged into `dev`, it will instantly be available to `stackql` applications configured to integrate the `dev` registry.  After an additional period of monitoring from the team, it will be promoted to our main / production branch.
